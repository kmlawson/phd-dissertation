# Wartime Atrocities and the Politics of Treason in the Ruins of the Japanese Empire, 1937-1953

This is a GitHub repository for the dissertation by Konrad M. Lawson, submitted to the History Department at Harvard University in 2012.

## Abstract 

This dissertation explores the relationship between violence and betrayal in retribution against military and police collaborators who helped maintain Japan's wartime occupations up until its defeat in 1945. Looking at the approaches taken in the colonies of British Asia, postwar treason trials in the Philippines, and Chinese Communist approaches in wartime and postwar Shandong province, this study argues that the laws and rhetoric of treason were deeply flawed tools for confronting the atrocities of war. At the very moment that war crimes trials were defining a set of acts that constituted crimes against all humanity, around the world thousands of individuals who helped perpetrate them were treated as primarily guilty of crimes against the nation. Each of the chapters in this work examines the costs and consequences of this for postwar societies on the eve of decolonization and civil war.

Throughout the territories under Japanese occupation, locally recruited military and police forces comprised the largest category of individuals to face accusations of treason in the aftermath of war, but were also those most likely to be complicit in atrocities. Among the ranks of the disloyal, they were both the most useful as well as the most dangerous to postwar regimes and almost always separated out from other accused collaborators. Their treason was often treated as a disease of the heart which, once cured, allowed them to be deployed once more. Attempts to try them for their betrayal often faced destabilizing political opposition, especially in cases where their wartime actions were carried out in the name of independence from colonial rule, and were almost always reduced in scale to focus on those accused both of treason and atrocities. Marred by the politics of betrayal, the resulting hybrid proceedings failed to achieve a reckoning with wartime massacres and torture.

Below is more information about the files in this repository.


# Raw Folder

This folder contains various documents converted from the Word Document that was the final version of the dissertation submited to Harvard DASH and ProQuest.

## Originals Folder

Contains the original files that together composed the dissertation.

### diss-body.docx

This is the Word document used to perform the below conversions and the document that was submitted to Harvard DASH and ProQuest after Appendices and Maps were added. Appendix A is included in the word document.

### appendix-b-philippine-trials.ods

LibreOffice/OpenOffice table of Philippine trials used as Appendix B

### appendix-c-puppet-armies.ods

LibreOffice/OpenOffice table of Puppet Army commanders used as Appendix C

### misc-map-data

I have, without much careful processing, moved my various QGIS project files and map data in here. May not be complete.

## Exports Folder

### html-export.html

This was created by exporting the Word document to HTML, then opening Adobe Dreamweaver and choosing "Clean Up Word HTML" to remove a lot of the extra code that Word adds.

I also tried "textutil" to HTML but this did not include any of the footnotes.

### html-pandoc-markdown.md

This was created by running "pandoc" conversion from the html-export.html (had to resave it as UTF-8) to markdown.

There are a lot of formatting issues to be fixed, tables to be redone, and the footnotes may need revisiting but this seemed to produce the result closest to what I wanted to achieve.

## Other Exports

These files are less successful or complete:

### textutil-html-export.html

This is what the export to HTML looked like when put through the "textutil" command. Note that there are no footnotes in this version

### textutil-html-pandoc-markdown.md

This is the footnote-less conversion from the textutil html to markdown.

## Note

The dissertation was composed entirely in Scrivener in Mac OS X. In the final days before submission, the entire dissertation was exported to Microsoft Word with some final editing and additions made in the final Word document. I have not re-imported the changed text into Scrivener. Had I done so, the export process for GitHub would have been significantly easier.
