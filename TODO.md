## Tasks

The GitHub repository contains a Markdown version of the dissertation but, because it was converted from the final Microsoft Word format that was submitted, there are huge formatting issues that need to be resolved. 

Some tasks ahead for this repository:

* Create chapter folders for the markdown version
* Break each chapter into its sub-sections and save into separate files
* Fix formatting issues
* Recompose tables in markdown format
* Review footnotes and make sure they are resolving correctly
* Confirm encoding for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean
