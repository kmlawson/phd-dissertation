## Tasks

The GitHub repository contains a Markdown version of the dissertation but, because it was converted from the final Microsoft Word format that was submitted, there are huge formatting issues that need to be resolved.

In its current state here, it is not convenient for others to fork and reuse it since the whole diss is in a single file. To break it into more manageable pieces, however, with chapters and sections, a lot of work has to be done, getting the various footnotes in the right place and fixing them, since the Word export and pandoc conversion mangled them. Preferrably this would be done gradually, as I fix formatting issues along the way. 

Some tasks ahead for this repository:

* Create chapter folders for the markdown version
* Break each chapter into its sub-sections and save into separate files
* Fix all the footnotes, which are currently broken, but likely fixable
* Fix formatting issues
* Recompose tables in markdown format
* Confirm encoding for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean
