 Though sometimes informers were included with them.

 This was not the case, however, in the Philippines. See Chapter Five.

 Only in one case mentioned briefly in Chapter Three, the mostly Sikh
police of Malaya, was there a large-scale purge. There were also
Nationalist purges of police in at least some areas of postwar China,
but that case has not been included in this dissertation.

 The best work on this specifically for the Japanese occupation
experience has been done on the Philippines. See Alfred McCoy, “Politics
by Other Means: World War II in the Western Visayas” in A. W. McCoy ed.
*Southeast Asia under Japanese occupation*. (New Heaven: Yale University

Resistance: Catalino Hermosilla and the Japanese Occupation of Ormoc,
Leyte (1942-1945)” *Philippine Studies* vol. 60 no. 1 (Sept. 2011)
33-68. In the Chinese case, there are also a number of works which focus
entirely on a single village or community and usually follow it across
the course of the revolution, including the Japanese occupation. Two
examples of this are Isabel Crook, *Ten Mile Inn: Mass Movement in a
Chinese Village*, (New York: Pantheon Books, 1979), and William
Hinton,*Fanshen: a Documentary of Revolution in a Chinese Village*
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966).

 The word comes from the name of Vidkun Quisling, the head of the
Norwegian fascist Nasjonal Samling party, enthusiastic suporter of the
German invasion of Norway in April, 1940, and wartime Minister President
from 1942. He was executed for treason in 1945.

 Treat “Choosing to Collaborate,” 91

 Treat also discusses Sartre’s famous essay “What is a Collaborator.”
This essay is famous, as Treat points out, for its depiction of
collaboration as a “strange mixture of masochism and homosexuality,”
which supports a “sexual union in which France plays the female role…”
However, the full essay shows the same confused depictions of
collaboration as a universal phenomenon and one tied to betrayal in the
context of a foreign occupation and illicit ties to the Other. It is,
for Sartre, a “normal phenomenon” which lies “latent” in peace, but is
elsewhere described more generally as anyone who is afflicted by, “that
intellectual illness that may be called historicism.” This historicism
yields a twisted realism which, “leads them to submit themselves to
rigorously individual realities: a man, a party or a foreign nation.”
See Jean-Paul Sartre “What is a Collaborator?” in Jean-Paul Sartre,

 Timothy Brook, “Hesitating Before the Judgment of History” *Journal of
Asian Studies* 71.1 (Feb, 2012), 105. Hilary Conroy, in his short essay
on collaboration, in which he also argued that the term was plagued by
its close orientation with the nation-state. Hilary Conroy “Thoughts on
Collaboration” Peace and Change 1.1 (1972), 43.  Brook goes beyond a
critique of the term to argue for a more cautious approach to moral
judgments about the past in general, offering instead a historian’s
imperative to produce “moral understanding” that is based upon an
appreciation for the contingent outcomes of the actions of historical
agents. I share with Treat a strong commitment to the moral agency of
the historian and am far less troubled than Brook by the consequences of
retroactive judgement in our craft. Brook wants to distinguish the work
of the moralizing ‘polemicist’ from that of the historian but his own
important study of local collaboration in occupation China goes farther
than most in carefully spelling out the consequences of collaboration in
the midst of mass atrocities. Nor does Brook shy away from drawing some
of the obvious conclusions, as he does when he evaluates the work of the
Self-Government Committee (自治委員會) in the newly Japanese occupied
city of Nanjing. When the body asserted control over refugees in
January, 1938 it aided a process in which males of fighting age were
extracted and handed over for execution which, as Brook points out,
amounted to, “complicity in war crimes.” Timothy Brook. *Collaboration:

 To this list Kundera would add, “All those who extol the mass media
din, advertising's imbecilic smile, the neglect of the natural world,
indiscretion raised to the status of a virtue – they deserve to be
called ‘collaborators with modernity.’” Kundera *Art of the Novel*, 125.

 In Japanese, for example, historians use the Korean term “pro-Japanese”
(親日派) when talking about collaboration in Korea, the Chinese term for
traitor (漢奸) or other more neutral terms for the specific factions
that worked for Japan. The more generic term for collaborators with
Japan (対日協力者) is only gradually being adopted in more recent works.
In Korean scholarship, various terms for traitor (민족반역자,
民族叛逆者) or pro-Japanese (친일파, 親日派) continue to be most
prominent, while later collaborators are sometimes described within a
general framework of fascism (파시즘).

the German case at Leipzig, and the earlier Constantinople

 The concept behind crimes against humanity was seen as derived from the
prologue to the 1907 Hague Convention, which referred to the laws of
humanity. The specific category of “crimes against humanity” was
proposed in 1919 in the “Report on the Commission on the
Responsibilities of the Authors of War and on Enforcement of Penalties,“
following the First World War, but due to American and Japanese
opposition, the proposal to prosecute such crimes was dropped. M. Cherif

the “subsequent proceedings,” the indictments did sometimes include
crimes against peace such as in the *Ministries* and *High Command*
trials. See Kevin Jon Heller, *The Nuremberg Military Tribunals and the
Origins of International Criminal Law* (OUP Oxford, 2011), 127. The
reverse was not true, since many of the leaders prosecuted at the IMTFE,
that are widely referred to as “Class A” war criminals were, in addition
to crimes against peace, also indicted and convicted on charges of
murder, crimes against humanity, and conventional war crimes. On the
inclusion of regular murder charges, and the reaction of the judges to
these counts, see Neil Boister, *The Tokyo International Military

 The most important scholarship on these trials has been done by Utsumi
Aiko 内海愛子 and Hayashi Hirofumi林博史, who have both written
extensively on the national level trials and the remarkable series of
documents edited by Chaen Yoshio茶園義男 remains the most important
published collection of primary materials on these trials. See for
example Aiko Utsumi 内海愛子, 朝鮮人BC急戦犯の記録 [A Record of Korean
Class BC War Criminals] (Tokyo: Keisō Shobō, 1982) and Hirofumi Hayashi
林博史, BC急戦犯裁判 [BC-Class War Crimes Trials] (Tokyo: Iwanami
Shoten, 2005). The U.S. military tribunals that convicted generals
Yamashita and Homma in the Philippines were an early topic of research
due to their important contribution to doctrine of command
responsibility. Philip Piccigalo’s work on allied war crimes trials in
Asia covered many of the national level trials but depended heavily on
contemporary press accounts and the fifteen volumes of the *Law Reports
of the Trials of War Criminals* selected by the United Nations War
Crimes Commission. Philip R. Piccigallo, *The Japanese on Trial: Allied
War Crimes Operations in the East, 1945-1951* (Austin: University of
Texas Press, 1979). Most recently studies of the Philippine national
trials have been completed by Nagai Hitoshi and Sharon Williams
Chamberlain. Hitoshi Nagai 永井均, フィリピと対日戦犯裁判1945-1953 [The

 William Colgan writes that orders were given to him in the units he
flew in to avoid “gunning down” or “going after” civilians, but admits
that it was “hard” to keep them separate. William B. Colgan, *Allied

York: McFarland, 2010), 186. Chuck Yeager claims in his autobiography
that he received orders in a 1944 mission to demoralize the population
by strafing anything that moved. Chuck Yeager and Leo Janos, *Yeager, an
Autobiography*(New York: Bantam Books, 1986), 62-63. Quoted, with
further discussion in James J. Weingartner, *Americans, Germans, and War
Crimes Justice: Law, Memory, and “The Good War”* (ABC-CLIO, 2011), 11.
The most damning evidence of how casually strafing of civilians was
taken, see Weingartner’s discussion of the wartime documentary
*Thunderbolt*, prepared by the U.S. war department, were we are given
actual footage of U.S. war crimes in action in Italy. For more evidence
and the impact of strafing of civilians from the perspective of
Italians, see James Holland,*Italy’s Sorrow: A Year of War, 1944-1945*
(New York: Macmillan, 2008), 392. The discovery of a Korean War
memorandum “Policy on Strafing Civilians” during investigations into the
massacre at No Gun Ri which noted that the Air Force had complied with
Army requests to date for the strafing of civilians shows that this
policy continued, at least in some cases, into the postwar.  The U.S.
military’s own review report admits to the existence of the memorandum
but overal denies that there was any explicit order to strafe civilians.

another 54 sentenced in court-martials for rape, pillage, and murder.

 In the case of Biscari, most of the accused escaped punishment while
the case of the Goums included summary executions and lack of command
responsibility for ensuring the discipline of troops, not to mention the
complicating factor of race.  I have found very little study that has
been done on the scope and nature of Chinese or Soviet military justice
for atrocities during the war.

 Trial statistics rarely made it clear how many of those prosecuted,
with the occasional exception of informers, were additionally accused of
being complicit in occupation atrocities, either in their own countries,
or on distant fronts. A lack of consistent patterns in the severity of
sentencing in most countries also make it difficult to  difficult to
easily classify cases which involved accusations of atrocity as well as
treason.

 See discussion of the comparison between the two in Ditlev Tamm “Phases
of Co-operation,” 1468-70. The Danish question was complicated by at
least two factors. One was a debate over in what sense Denmark was, like
other countries considered at war with a country which completed its
occupation of the country in less than a day. The second was whether
acts of collaboration before 1943, when the minimal German interference
in Danish affairs began to change radically, were to be included as
collaboration.

 As with many wanted German war criminals who escaped with the help of
Catholic networks, many *miliciens* sought refuge in French and Canadian
monasteries. John Hellman, “Monasteries, Miliciens, War Criminals: Vichy
France/Quebec, 1940-50,” Journal of Contemporary History 32, no. 4
(October 1, 1997). As for the wartime conduct and the early postwar fate
of regular French police who served during the occupation is a complex
one with significant regional variation. In Marseille, at least, a purge
of the police was carried out relatively early. See Simon Kitson, “The
Police in the Liberation of Paris” in H.R. Kedward and Nancy Wood eds.

 There are seven men whose cases are frequently referred to, the first
three of which are most often the subject of the “Red Fort Trials.” Fay
claims to have found mention of some ten total cases before a communique
in May, 1946 brought them to an end. However, the treason charge was
likely dropped in these later cases after a consensus on this was
reached to eliminate the treason charge in February. Peter Ward Fay,

 The history of the Indian National Army is a complex one and will not
be reviewed in detail. Already before the fall of Singapore some 200
“Fujiwara volunteers” had formed, named for the then Major Fujiwara
Iwaichi, whose intelligence outfit the *Fujiwara Kikan* was responsible
for creating an army of Indian volunteers. However, the term “Fujiwara
volunteers” are elsewhere described as those who joined just after
Singapore fell. The “first” Indian National Army that grew out of it
commanded by Mohan Singh and tied to the Indian Independence League led
by Rash Behari Bose in Tokyo. This first INA was disbanded by Singh in
December, 1942, after which he was arrested by the Japanese. The INA
only revived with the arrival of Subhas Chandra Bose in the summer of
1943. For this earlier period see Hugh Toye “The First Indian National
Army, 1941-42.” *Journal of Southeast Asian Studies* 15, no. 2
(September 1, 1984): 365-381.

 The Spanish Civil War and the Winter War in Finland were the other two
major conflicts of the 20th century in which foreign volunteers figured
prominently.

 This 1929 agreement offered protections for Prisoners of War and barred
them performing any labor connected with the operations of war. Germany
ratified the agreement. Japan signed but did not ratify it.

 Troops of the Indian Legion eventually fought briefly in the Infantry
Regiment 950. See Rudolf Hartog, *Im Zeichen Des Tigers: Die Indische
Legion Auf Deutscher Seite, 1941-1945* (Herford: Busse Seewald, 1991).

 Samuel J. Newland, *Cossacks in the German army, 1941-1945*(F. Cass,
1991). On their role in anti-partisan warfare in Yugoslavia see 150-169.

 From early 1942, German Divisions were permitted to recruit several
thousand auxiliary troops from among POWs. Newland ibid., 46. The number
of Western POWs recruited, including the famous British Free Corps,
never exceeded a few dozen.

 See Catherine Andreyev, *Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Movement:
Soviet Reality and Emigré Theories* (Cambridge University Press, 1990).

 For the most part, however, these were mobilized not as armed soldiers
but as agents of propaganda. After Japan’s defeat a considerable number
of surrendered Japanese soldiers did fight in the Chinese Civil War and
were utilized by the British in Southeast Asia. See Donald G, Gillin and
Charles Etter. “Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China,
1945-1949.” *The Journal of Asian Studies* 42, no. 3 (May 1, 1983):

 Peter Fay addresses the wide disagreement over the total number of INA,
see Fay ibid., 459. One detailed January 1946 report on the total number
of INA and charts of what units they came from in “Note by C.S.D.I.C.
Red Fort, Delhi on the Number of Indian PW who Joined the INA” W.O.
208/818 P.R.O. *INA Documents*vol. 5, 311. There is also a named list of
1602 deceased INA ‘martyrs’ and what is surely a very incomplete list of
over 14,000 INA veterans listed in the three volumes by the All India
INA Committee. S. S. Yadava ed. *Forgotten Warriors of Indian War of

 According to one estimate, there were only some 5,000 “staunch
non-volunteers” among some 45,000 POWs who were gathered for recruitment
into the INA in Singapore on February 17, 1942. See Fay ibid., 525. For
a perspective which explores the success of the INA in recruiting POWs
in the earlier stages in the broader context of the history of the
Indian Army see Trak Barkawi, “Culture and Combat in the Colonies: The
Indian Army in the Second World War.” *Journal of Contemporary History*
41, no. 2 (April 1, 2006): 325-355.

 This is according to testimony in the early postwar trials of former
Indian POWs who refused to join. For a summary of witness accounts of
beatings for refusing to volunteer see “Prosecution Address at I.N.A.
Trial, Red Fort” in *Indian National Army: A Documentary Study*, vol. 5,

Kumaran T. P. not on this list but listed as executed among the list of
deceased INA that follows, 192. Harkirat Singh says 27 INA were
court-martialed during the Imphal campaign of 1944, 9 of which were
hanged. See Harkirat Singh, *The INA Trial and the Raj* (New Delhi:
Atlantic Publishers & Distributors, 2003), 38. Peter Fay also counts 9
hanged during the war. See Fay *Forgotten Army*, 439. Some other non-INA
affiliated Indians accused of being spies in Japanese service were also
imprisoned or executed within India during the war. The judgment in one
April 1943 trial of 19 accused enemy agents, two of which were sentenced
to death can be found in “Trial of enemy agents at Madras” File No.

 These efforts at secrecy largely failed, however, as information about
Blacks leaked out as hundreds of Grays and Whites were released and

reported to have “recovered” in the Holiday Rest Camp.

options by suggesting that, up until this point, only a few cases had
become “ripe for prosecution” and thus had resulted in convictions.
However, this ignored the fact that those few convictions that had been
reached during the war led directly, as noted above, to orders being
given which required special permission to proceed with Courts of
Inquiry. In other words, any requisite ripening was being actively
prevented by the army.

 Like so many similar numbers of estimates regarding the INA used in the
weeks to come, this round number was produced at a time when thousands
of INA had yet to be interrogated. “Governor-General (War Department) to
Secretary of State” (11 Aug., 1945) L/PO/10/25 *TOP* v. 6 \#17, 49. The
total of all those held is not listed, but a later October report lists
16,000 total INA who were formerly Indian Army that had been recovered.
The number is thus likely something under 16,000. Fay suggests that
7,000 INA had reached India by September, and 12,000 by November. Fay,

armed insurgency by former INA and Indian legionaries was a realistic
threat in India, the role later played by former members of the
Japanese-trained Burma National Army forces as leverage by Aung San in
Burma negotiations, as we shall see in Chapter Four suggests that the
fears were not unreasonable. Likewise, Japanese-trained PETA volunteers
would go on to play a prominent role in the independence struggle in the
Dutch East Indies.

about their impact. Later Sir Jwala Prasad Srivastava, a member of the
Governor’s Executive Council arrived and asked Wavell to call off all
the INA trials.

 The execution is remembered as part of what has become known as the
Selarang Barracks Incident at Changi prison in September, 1942 when the
camp’s POWs almost all refused to obey a Japanese order to sign a
document pledging not to attempt escape from the camp. Following the
execution, the prisoners were all crammed into a small area around the
central square of the camp in dangerously cramp conditions which
eventually lead to compliance. The attempt to compel the prisoners to
sign, and the moving of the prisoners into the square comprised the
other charge in Fukuei’s postwar trial. Havers offers a full chapter
account of the incidnet in *ibid.,*65-80. A synopsis of Fukue’s war
crimes trial, no. 235/825, and the identification of Captain Rawa as the

 This was not the first incident of a similar kind. It was preceded in
1939, by another incidents in Egypt and elsewhere involving resistance
to wearing steel helmets by Sikhs. Johannes H. Voigt.*India in the
Second World War.* (New Delhi: Arnold-Heinemann, 1987), 65. This
suspicion was no doubt strengthened by, around the same time, the escape
to Japanese occupied Guangzhou of three civilian Sikhs who had been
arrested for spreading sedition. In Guangzhou, the three soon received
the help of none other than INA founder Major Fujiwara Iwaichi who
secured them passage to Bangkok.^⁠^^^For more on the “steel helmet”

 Ibid., 145. Hartog mentions that several German officers who were
charged with condoning war crimes in a postwar trial Bordeaux were
acquitted and that the evidence was based on “uncorroborated reports of
atrocities by the Indian troops…which were circulated by the French
resistance.” Hartog may be referring to above cited reports by local
officials. He expresses frustration at being unable to convince a
student studying the conduct of the Legion in France that these charges
were false.  Ibid., 147. The student may have been R. G. Loosmore, who
wrote his M.A. thesis, “The Springing Tigers in France, 1944” in 1983 at
University of Leicester. The thesis contains very few citations and no
page numbers, making it hard to use but is perhaps the only work to
focus specifically on the Legion activities during this time.

 A third difference that might be noted with regards to the specific
nature of the treason in question is that, while the INA was composed in
large part of deserters, which thus stood in strong contrast to loyal
Indians who continue to fight for the British throughout the war, there
were few Burmese veterans of British forces within the BNA, not
surprising given the fact the British rarely recruited among ethnic
Burmans. See Annexure III in “Cabinet: India and Burma Committee. Paper

launch a failed attack on the French forces in September 1940. Their

 It is tempting to include China here, but though contemporaries might
have made a similar claim, it is a far more complex case, as is
discussed in other chapters. The continuities of elites in one local
region is considered in Alfred McCoy, “Politics by Other Means: World
War II in the Western Visayas” in A. W. McCoy ed. *Southeast Asia under
Japanese occupation*. (New Heaven: Yale University Southeast Asia
Studies), 158-203.

 Quoted in Steinberg ibid., 139. Later, a more sympathetic People's
Court judge appointed by President Roxas would approve of this same
"catchy" plea, saying that pro-Japanese speeches by wartime leaders were
all "shields to protect the people from the brutality of the enemy."
Eusebio Lopez quoted in Steinberg, ibid., 159.

 Aquino is the son of Corazon Aquino, an even more important figure in
Philippine history. As the first woman to hold the office, “Cory” Aquino
served as president from 1986-1992 after leading the opposition movement
which toppled the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. She rose to prominence
after her husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., a longtime opponent of Marcos,
was assassinated in 1983. José Rizal was is an author and nationalist
reformer who was executed by the Spanish in 1896.

 For a selection of Recto’s wartime speeches, see Claro M Recto, *The
Complete Works of Claro M. Recto,*  (Manila: Claro M. Recto Memorial
Foundation, 1990) v. 5, 295-407. See also practically every *Official
Gazette* issue from 1943-1944, which included the texts of major
speeches delivered by officials.

 Recto’s argument at trial was edited and published as Claro M. Recto,
*Three Years of Enemy Occupation: The Issue of Political Collaboration
in the Philippines* (Manila: People’s Publishers 1946). The actual
briefs he submitted for the Supreme Court (Laurel vs. Misa G.R. No. 409
January 30, 1947, 77 Phil. 856) which lay out his argument of “suspended
sovereignty” can be found in Claro M Recto,*Complete Works*, v. 6,
1-469. The Anastacio Laurel in Laurel vs. Misa was not a relation of
José P. Laurel.

Philippines, 1941-45* (Quezon City: R.P. Garcia Pub. Co, 1965), v. 1 and

 Manuel L. Quezon was president of the Philippine Commonwealth from 1935
until 1944. He retreated into exile with American forces in 1942. Marcos
was president and later dictator of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986.

 There is much uncertainty around the execution order itself. See
Leocadio De Asis,*The Thread of Fate: A Personal Story in
Philippine-Japanese Relations* (Makati, Metro Manila: Philippine
Foundation of Japan Alumni, 1986), 134-5.

 José was the younger brother of Pedro Abad Santos, founder of the
Socialist Party of the Philippines which eventually merged into a
popular front with the Communist Party in 1938. Unlike his far more
conservative brother, Pedro was not executed following his capture by
the Japanese and survived until his release in 1944.

 For excerpts and descriptions of some of the memorial speeches, awards,
and related honors bestowed on him, see Ramon C. Aquino, *A Chance to
Die; a Biography of José Abad Santos, Late Chief Justice of the
Philippines* (Quezon City: Alemar-Phoenix Publishing House, 1967),

 Ibid. Recto says he signed first, but his name actually comes third
after Jorge B. Vargas and José Yulo. A photo of the document is in
Armando J. Malay, *Occupied Philippines: the Role of Jorge B. Vargas
During the Japanese Occupation* (Manila: Filipiniana Book Guild, 1967),
81.

 Vargas dropped him by executive order in May along with others to
replace them with more clearly pro-Japanese members such as Pio Duran
and Artemio Ricarte. Steinberg, David Joel Steinberg,*Philippine
Collaboration in World War II*(Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press,
1967), 64. Quirino was briefly imprisoned by the Japanese on suspicion
of having contact with guerrillas later that year, but released after
two weeks.

 Despite this, when he was first elected president in 1949, he issued an
amnesty for Japanese war criminals serving sentences for war crimes in
Muntinlupa Prison. Leocadio De Asis,*The Thread of Fate*, 96.

occupation is found in Marcial Primitivo Lichauco, R*oxas; the Story of
a Great Filipino and of the Political Era in Which He Lived* (Manila:
Kiko Printing Press, 1952), 154-198.

 The argument is frequently put this way by the leading politcial
collaborators. See for example, Claro M. Recto, *Three Years of Enemy

perhaps more known as a symbol of Spanish rule, and the imprisonment
there of José Rizal and other Filipino nationalists. On the later 1975

 The term “police” refers to the Bureau of Constabulary, since the two
were essentially merged by the Japanese by wartime. These examples are
taken from a collection of translated mopping up reports from early
1944. General Headquarters, Far East Command, Military Intelligence

 Among the Japanese forces of the 14th and 16th Armies that invaded the
Philippines were the 16th and 18th infantry divisions which both fought
in North China, Shanghai, and most infamously, the attack on Nanjing, as
well as the 4th, 5th, and 21st infantry divisions which had all been
fighting in the Sino-Japanese war since at least 1938.

Terami-Wada argues that many members believed the name came from a
Tagalog bible verse, James 1:4 "And let endurance have its perfect
result, so that you may be *perfect* and *complete*, lacking in
nothing." In Tagalog, perfect and complete are translated "sakdal at
ganap" "The Sakdal Movement" *Philippine Studies*36 n. 2 (1988), 133.
There are a number of differing accounts on the origin of the name.

 My summary of the movement's history here is based on Motoe
Terami-Wada's article "The Sakdal Movement.”

 Artemio Ricarte's relationship to Japan is outlined in Goodman, Grant

 Bose was under house arrest when he fled to Germany, arriving there in
April, 1941 and then traveling on to Japanese occupied Singapore in
1943. Wang Jingwei left suddenly for Hanoi in late 1938, leaving
Nationalist China in one of its darkest moments of retreat.

 Two other complicated exceptions are Indochina and Thailand. In
Indochina the political infrastructure of the now Vichy French colonial
regime was kept in place. Thailand was officially an ally of Japan and
though 'host' to tens of thousands of Japanese occupation troops, it did
not have its regime replaced by the Japanese.

problematic evaluations of the motives of Philippine collaborators found
in US documents was bitterly contested by their sympathizers, who noted
that they were based upon greatly limited and biased wartime sources. In
this case, for example, at odds with this harsh evaluation is the fact
that, in 1938, Paredes chaired a Manila rally to protest the persecution
of Jews after Kristallnacht. *Frank Ephraim, Escape to Manila: from Nazi
tyranny to Japanese terror*(Champaign: University of Illinois Press,

Philippine Laws and Jurisprudence Databank, created by the Arellano Law
Foundation, which is a non-profit institution specializing in legal

 Only a few unusual cases are from after the 1953 pardon.

 On the size of the BC in August, 1944, see Ricardo T. Jose *Captive
Arms: The Constabulary Under the Japanese, 1942-1944* (Manila:
University of the Philippines, 1997), 12. Mass desertions from the BC
began around that time as air attacks by the US began, ibid., 18.

 A full copy of the 1930 Revised Penal Code, which for the most part is
in force today, is in the Philippine Laws and Jurisprudence Databank
LawPhil database.
http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/acts/act\_3815\_1930.html (Accessed June
20, 2011).The automatic review process did not include death sentences
imposed by military courts. The death penalty was effectively abolished
in the new constitution in 1987 in Article III Section 19 which required
Congressional action to permit it. A law reinstating it was passed in
1993, but it was again abolished in 2006.

 Article 34 of the Revised Penal Code, ibid., denies those sentenced to
civil interdiction, "rights of parental authority, or guardianship,
either as to the person or property of any ward, of marital authority,
of the right to manage his property and of the right to dispose of such
property…" Article 27 gives the range for *reclusion perpetua*. One of
the two exceptions, Roman Vilo, who had his death sentence affirmed by
the Supreme Court was listed among those who received a pardon in 1953.

 The other members with service in the occupation period were Cesar
Bengzon and Manuel Briones. See Hernando J Abaya, *Betrayal in the
Philippines* (Quezon City: Malaya Books, 1970), 82. Bengzon would later
go on to serve as Chief Justice in the 1960s. A prewar senator and
member of the constitutional convention, Briones would run as Vice
President on Jose P. Laurel’s 1949 run for President.

 Like almost all official biographies of leading collaborators in the
Philippines, Moran’s entry on the Philippine Supreme Court e-Library’s
“Memorabilia Room” makes no mention of his wartime position as Chief
Justice, and instead merely lists his postwar appointment as such from
July 1945.

 A catch-all principle, known as the “Martens Clause” found in the
preamble of the 1899 and 1907 Hague conventions calls for “cases not
covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians
and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the
principles of international law derived from established custom, from
the principles of humanity and from dictates of public conscience.” A
source of much debate in international law, it has been used to argue
that unlawful combatants receive protection but according to Kevin Jon
Heller, it was not employed in the early postwar war crimes trials. It
has, however, become increasingly recognized as part of customary
international law in recent decades. Kevin Jon Heller *The Nuremberg
Military Tribunals and the Origins of International Criminal Law* (New
York: Oxford University Press US, 2011), 209. Yutaka Arai *The Law of

Article 4.

 Even in Protocol I extending the Geneva Conventions in 1977, which the
US is one of the few countries not to ratify, dissident forces are only
recognized as such when they do not conceal their allegiance and must be

 The *summary execution* of guerrillas that was so commonly carried out
by Japanese soldiers, without any form of judicial proceeding, even if
merely involved a quasi-judicial hearing by a single officer of
significant rank, was consistently held to be a war crime. Some of the
war crimes counts against General Yamashita, for example, were for
having executed suspected guerrillas without any kind of judicial
proceeding. *United States v. Tomoyuki Yamashita*in *Law Reports of
Trials of War Criminals*v. 4, 34. Furthermore, in several Nuremberg
cases, judges showed no tolerance for sweepingly broad definitions of
partisans to include any obstructing civilians.  Heller *Nuremberg

 At any rate, a  full recognition of sexual crimes as war crimes and
addressing them as such in either international or civil conflicts is
not enough, however. As Carol Cohn puts it, “If rape’s use as a weapon
of war is your concern, for example, you can safely contest the meanings
of “war crime” or “crimes against humanity,” and hope that through
redefining rape as a war crime, rather than a ‘natural,’ ‘inevitable,’
‘boys-will-be-boys’ inherent aspect of war, there will be some deterrent
effect. But if it is off-limits to address the intersections of gender
and ethnicity, and the gender regime that makes a physical, sexual
attack on a woman a blow against the ‘honour’ of a man and his
community, how likely is it that rape will stop being used as a weapon?”

explanation for pardons of the Japanese to be included in the “annual
amnesty proclamation” announced on June 27. Cable No. 3904 Manila to
Secretary of State (June 30, 1953), 796.00/6-3053 RG 59.

 The news was reported internationally as a side note. For example,
“President Quirino also announced that 350 Filipinos convicted as
wartime collaborators would be pardoned.” in “Philippines to Free
Japanese Captives” *New York Times* (June 28, 1953), 2. Though the
pardons did not take effect until July 4, they were issued on the 27th
of June, the day the president departed the Philippines to receive
medical treatment in the United States.

 The clipping from the July 4, 1953 issue of the *Manila Times*  was an
attachment to “List of Names of Filipino Prisoners Pardoned by President
QUIRINO on July 4, 1953” (July 21, 1953) 796.00/7-1053 RG 59.

 A despatch from the embassy back to the United States describes those
pardoned as those “convicted of treason or other offenses involving
collaboration with the enemy during the Japanese occupation by the
defunct people’s court and courts of first instance.” “List of Names of
Filipino Prisoners Pardoned by President QUIRINO on July 4, 1953” (July
21, 1953) 796.00/7-1053 RG 59. Nagai Hitoshi refers only to pardons from
the people’s court as receiving pardon but given the fact that there
were more pardons than People’s Court convictions, this seems to be
merely an omission. Nagai, *Firipin to Tainichi Senpan Saiban*, 288.

 “If Laurel used a broadsword and Tanada a battleaxe to criticize
Elpidio, Recto, a poet in Spanish during his newspaper days, used a
rapier.” Explaining to Camilo Osias the difference between the
definitions of the words ‘calamity’ and ‘catastrophe,’ Recto is quoted
as saying, “if President Quirino should fall into the Pasig river and
drowned, that would be a calamity but if someone fished him out alive -
that would be a catastrophe!” Carlos Quirino, *Apo Lakay: The Biography
of President Elpidio Quirino of the Philippines*, (Makati, Metro Manila:

 A summary of this episode can be found in *The Complete Works of Claro

June 15, 2010. Also, around the same time, Quirino told a Japanese
diplomat the pardon was entirely driven by a Christian spirit. Nagai
Hitoshi suggests another related influence on a religious Quirino may
have been the interest the Vatican took in the issue of showing mercy to
the Japanese war criminals. Nagai *Firipin to Tainichi Senpan Saiban*,
282. The announcement on the evening of June 27th by the presidential
office however, connected the “gesture” of the pardons to the
improvement of relations and the reparations issue directly. A more
direct *quid pro quo* has also been suggested. While no direct evidence
has emerged, Nagai writes there is some  possibility that accusations
published elsewhere that a direct payment made to the Quirino regime
behind the scenes for the pardons may have merit, and statements made
immediately after the announcement of the pardons continued to suggest
Quirino was hoping the pardons would have an impact on reparations
negotiations. See discussion by Nagai, *Firipin to Tainichi Senpan
Saiban*,  282-292, and Chamberlain, “Justice and Reconciliation”,
180-190. Ricardo T. Jose suggests that growing U.S. pressure on the
Philippines to give up their attempt to secure reparations may have been
a factor. Ricardo T. Jose “The Philippine War Crimes Trials, 1947-1949”

 *Congressional Record: House of Representatives*ibid., v. 3 no. 14 (Feb
12, 1948), 307. In his memoirs, Quirino attributes the origins of the
word *poorarian* to Cases, saying it meant “lover of the poor” but in
this context, he seems to be using it to mean the military collaborators
and those accused of atrocities who predominantly came from the lower
classes. Elpidio Quirino,*The Memoirs of Elpidio Quirino* (National

effect on his campaign,” and includes the quote about passing hate down
to the next generation from above. No mention of the pardons are to be
found in Salvador P Lopez, *Elpidio Quirino: The Judgment of History*
(President Elpidio Quirino Foundation, 1990) or Carlos Quirino *Apo

 Landrum, Bruce D “The Yamashita War Crimes Trial: Command
Responsibility Then and Now.”*Military Law Review* 149 (Summer 1995):
296. Landrum argues that two Nuremberg Trials**of 1948 weakened command
responsibility by adjusting the requirement from the idea that the
officers “must have known” to a “should have known” standard and thus “a
commander’s knowledge of widespread atrocities within the command area
was rebuttably presumed rather than irrebuttably presumed.” ibid., 298.
This less harsh “should have known” standard is the one that is
generally  by the International Criminal Court today.

 The suspension of habeas corpus allowed the Constabulary to detain
suspected Huks for an indeterminate period of time.  Though this was an
alarming reduction in the protection of a suspect’s legal rights, in the
short term it may have had the immediate effect of contributing to a
decline in summary executions and the number of those “killed while
trying to escape” given that there was no longer any fear that those
captured with little evidence of their guilt would be released the

the cities, and thousands of informers and military police auxiliaries
who aided Japanese counter-insurgency efforts throughout the country.

 In addition to Han Chinese, Mongolian troops represented a very
significant number of military collaborators in Northern China. White
Russians and local Korean minorities were also found in significant
numbers.

out the large-scale 1944 Ichigō campaign but the success of this
campaign hinged on a further degrading of the Japanese position in rear

the complex world of betrayal all this took place in. He was a confidant
of Dai Li, the head of *juntong*until his death in 1945 and was head of
the *juntong* station in Nanjing at the time of the trial. However, by
the time he testified at Zhou Fohai’s trial where he also testified to
Zhou Fohai’s cooperation with *juntong* and embarrassed the Nationalist
party, Zhou had allegedly already secretly joined the Communist party
and would soon be under arrest himself. Whether his claims about Zhou
Fohai, Wu Huawen and other puppet commander relations with *juntong*
were true is thus complicated by his potential other loyalties at the
time.  See Guo Biqiang 郭必強 周佛海身邊的軍統少將 [The *Juntong*General

 What was true in Shandong may not have held for other areas where
Communist led guerrillas were active. Despite following similar policies
and finding recognizable patterns in the broad sweep of political and
military campaigns, it is important to recognize the considerable local
variation in various areas held by Communist forces. Even limiting the
discussion to Shandong, this chapter does not do full justice to the
occasional divergences between Communist forces operating near the
Yimeng mountains and the rest of central Shandong, and those in the
hills of the Jiaodong peninsula.

 Quoted in ibid., 253. Memo for CG 14th USAF et al., 30 Jan 1945.
Wedemeyer may never have seen Zhu De’s request, or at least, he did not
take the use of puppet troops very seriously. When pressed on the issue
of underutilizing puppet troops in China before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, Wedemeyer was unable to say anything intelligent
about them, except to recall vaguely that some had served the Japanese
under a “general named Wang.”  See the discussion on the Senate episode
in John Hunter Boyle,*China and Japan at War, 1937-1945: The Politics of
Collaboration*(Stanford University Press, 1972), 318.

 This was a number consistent with Zhu De’s estimate for Shandong
supplied to the U.S. Military around the same time. By contrast, only
200 Koreans and Japanese had been won over. 15:123

 The “war criminal” (戰犯) was most likely Chinese. In contrast with
Nationalist legal cases, in Communist documents the term was not
exclusively used for Japanese soldiers. The ethnicity of the accused was
not explicitly clarified in this case but others mentioned in the
document were puppet soldiers and various other Chinese collaborators,
with no reference made to Japanese soldiers. A chart it included divided
those who were put before mass rallies into Nationalist spy suspected of
treason (國（兼漢奸）特), puppet official (偽官長), enemy spy (敵特),
puppet soldier(偽（兵）軍), and generic traitor (漢奸). 16 out of 155
were executed.  Rizhao county Public Security Bureau 日照縣公安局

 One possible exception is the small number of wartime collaborators
(including the last Qing emperor Pu Yi) returned from Soviet custody and
Chinese Nationalist figures who were sent as war criminals to the Fushun
War Criminals Management Center in 1949 and the 1950s. Their cases are
in need of study.

 French war criminals of Indochina and Algeria, for example, were
protected by amnesties passed in the 1960s. Further, “crimes against
humanity” were, until very recently, only recognized in postwar France
when the accused were connected to the Axis powers, as established in
the London Charter. Yves Beigbeder, *Judging War Crimes and Torture:
French Justice and International Criminal Tribunals and Commissions*

discussion of British torture techniques in various colonial contexts
see, Darius Rejali, *Torture and Democracy*(Princeton University Press,
2009), 330-1. The United Kingdom did eventually come before the European
Court of Human Rights in 1978, in *Republic of Ireland v. United
Kingdom* for its ‘five techniques’ of torture of Irish Republican Army
suspects. However, not only was this an international suit, one of few
before the European court, but also these did not include the beating,
flogging, and electricity used in some of its colonial territories. For
more on the case see John Conroy, *Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People:
The Dynamics of Torture* (Berkeley, Calif: University of California
Press, 2001), 123-128. A broader discussion of

 One of the important exceptions to this is the political and social
theorist Jon Elster, who has argued persuasively that study of
transitional justice as such must not limit itself to modern or
democratic regimes. Only by studying the larger universe of cases–and
his work looks as far back as ancient Athens–can we fully appreciate the
ways in which, for example, communities learn from past transitions. Jon

 Opposition to the court in the United Nations Committee on
International Criminal Jurisdiction was worried about the lack of a
clear code of law, on rules over jurisdiction and enforcement
possibilities. Remedying this problem would require, as their concluding
report in 1953 admitted, a surrender of state sovereignty that was
highly unlikely to be achieved. Michael J. Struett, *The Politics of

efforts have been hampered by the current administration which has
decried the way these investigations, including the act against
collaborators, has become a political weapon of its opponents, but in
this it strongly resembles the way in which the shifting politics of
post-1989 politics in East Europe has had a heavy impact on whether or
not lustration and prosecutions are carried out. See Monika Nalepa,
