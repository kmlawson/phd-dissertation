    dissertation explores the relationship between violence and betrayal in retribution
    against military and police collaborators who helped maintain Japan’s wartime
    occupations up until its defeat in 1945. Looking at the approaches taken in the
    colonies of British Asia, postwar treason trials in the Philippines, and
    Chinese Communist approaches in wartime and postwar Shandong province, this
    study argues that the laws and rhetoric of treason were deeply flawed tools for
    confronting the atrocities of war. At the very moment that war crimes trials
    were defining a set of acts that constituted crimes against all humanity,
    around the world thousands of individuals who helped perpetrate them were
    treated as primarily guilty of crimes against the nation. Each of the chapters
    in this work examines the costs and consequences of this for postwar societies
    on the eve of decolonization and civil war.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%'><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Throughout the territories under Japanese
    occupation, locally recruited military and police forces comprised the largest
    category of individuals to face accusations of treason in the aftermath of war,
    but were also those most likely to be complicit in atrocities. Among the ranks
    of the disloyal, they were both the most useful as well as the most dangerous
    to postwar regimes and almost always separated out from other accused
    collaborators. Their treason was often treated as a disease of the heart which,
    once cured, allowed them to be deployed once more. Attempts to try them for
    their betrayal often faced destabilizing political opposition, especially in
    cases where their wartime actions were carried out in the name of independence
    from colonial rule, and were almost always reduced in scale to focus on those
    accused both of treason and atrocities. Marred by the politics of betrayal, the
    resulting hybrid proceedings failed to achieve a reckoning with wartime
    massacres and torture.</span></p>

    and bibliographies rarely reveal the most important intellectual debts and
    inspirations of a student. This moment of transition is a good time to reflect
    upon them and express my gratitude. My deep thanks to my parents, who never
    failed to encourage me in my studies, and supported me through years of study
    in far off lands. Thanks to my uncle Thomas Nilsen who, from a small white
    house in Norway, opened a window for me onto Asia. For first introducing me to his
    craft, I must thank the remarkable historian Gunnar Skadberg who, in his own
    white house on the fjord just down the hill, shared with me his many adventures
    into the past. Without the encouragement of my Chinese and Japanese language
    professors Kathleen Tomlonovic and Robert Campbell at Western Washington
    University, I would likely never have considered graduate school. I can trace
    the final decision to pursue a PhD in history to a single moment in 2001 while
    doing an almost practical masters degree in International Affairs at Columbia
    University. With her usual passion, Carol Gluck was explaining the role of
    historians in society, adding that they must be driven by, “big questions, deep
    empiricism, and fire in the belly.” I thank her for that, and for occasionally
    reminding me that the nation-state is not dead yet. At Columbia I must also
    thank Jai Kasturi, a truly remarkable intellectual who opened up many a world
    of ideas to me, as well as Sutaitai (C. P. Sobelman) for encouraging me to
    explore new ways of employing technology in teaching and learning. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;text-autospace:ideograph-numeric ideograph-other'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:
200%'>I began my graduate study of history with a strong interest in the
    history of Sino-Japanese interactions. My thanks to both Josh Fogel and Hirano
    Kenichiro, my advisor during my time at Waseda University as a Ministry of
    Education research student, for encouraging me in these studies. Hirano-sensei
    taught me many things, but more than his broad and deep knowledge I was
    constantly impressed at his leadership, his humility, and as a teacher, his
    remarkable ability to gently guide his seminar students to the seeming
    self-discovery of shortcomings in our arguments. Having found them, he would
    then always offer a few ways forward. In Japan, where I spent most of my time
    studying China and Taiwan, much of my free time was in the company of the
    inspiring Korean students around me. My interest in Korea grew much as a
    result, especially thanks to the friendship of my fellow student of
    Sino-Japanese relations Lim Jaehwan and Japan historian Kim Youngsoo.</span></p>

    to Harvard for the PhD, I could not have asked for a better advisor than Andrew
    Gordon. He never wavered in his support and has perfectly mastered that rare
    balance between allowing graduate students to explore and grow on the one hand,
    and guiding us gently towards completion on the other. Generous with his time,
    fair in his critique, and always constructive in his advice, it has been a true
    honor to be counted among his students. I am also deeply grateful to Henrietta
    Harrison, Charles Maier, and Carter Eckert for their guidance. I think Henrietta
    Harrison was probably right when she made a passing suggestion long ago: this
    project would have been a lot less overwhelming if I had just found myself a
    nice Chinese village or two to focus my study of the politics of retribution.
    Maybe next time.</span></p>

    research in China, Taiwan, and Korea was generously supported by an SSRC International
    Dissertation Research Fellowship, a Fulbright IIE grant, and summer grants of
    the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies and the Asia Center. The
    librarians and staff at the Harvard-Yenching Library were extremely helpful and
    I look forward to seeing them on many future visits. My materials from Korea
    and Taiwan will feature in a manuscript based on this dissertation and other
    projects in incubation, but here I want to thank those who helped me do the
    research that will make it possible. In Taipei, I owe much to the friendship
    and support of Lin Yung-chung, Daphné Liu, Samantha Wu, David Toman, Shadow
    Chen, Huang Yao Hsien, Jimmy Haver, Hardina Ohlendorf, Lin Chia-ying, and
    Vanessa Yang. In Seoul, I must thank Baek Young-seo and the Institute For
    Korean Studies at Yonsei University for hosting my research year there. Thanks
    also to Lee Sunkyoung for always being able to tell me exactly where and how to
    get pretty much anything done, and to the four language partners who also became
    dear friends, Hong Sookyeong, Lee Changnam, Park Sunyoung, and Yi Sangwook. Xu
    Chang at the School of History and Culture at Shandong University made my
    research in Jinan possible, and his student Cao Yuanqiang was incredibly
    helpful in helping me find materials. Arne Brasseur and his band of merry
    adventurers kept me sane. Thanks to the archivists and staff of the Shandong Provincial
    Archive who put up with my endless requests for documents.</span></p>

    friends and fellow students made almost every moment of this process a
    pleasure. Almost every memory of my first few years in the PhD program features
    my fellow musketeers Craig Colbeck and Nick Kapur. They were wonderful
    companions. Fabian Drixler has also been a truly wonderful mentor and friend. I
    learnt so much from our long conversations. Brendan Karch helped me develop as
    a teacher, writer, and a semi-civilized social animal. Thanks to Denise Ho for
    all the treason tidbits, and to Josh Hill, Pär Cassel, Matsutani Motokazu, and
    Danny Orbach for everything you taught me. Also, everyone should have a Jeremy
    Yellen around: thank you for your energy, your stories, and I look forward to
    our future collaborations. Winnie Wong and Rossen Djagalov became wonderful
    comrades and I especially appreciated their encouragement during my push
    through to the finish. The same to Rachel Leow and Javier Cha, my two biggest
    inspirations in the digital humanities. Sayaka Chatani is in many ways my
    closest fellow traveller, chasing the questions of history across many
    countries and languages. I look forward to many years of sharing discoveries.
    Heather, thank you so much for your patience. This dissertation is dedicated to
    my sister Carleen, in admiration of her devotion to family and community.</span></p>

line-height:200%;"Minion Pro"'>The end of the Second World
    War was also a momentous beginning in efforts to punish the crimes of war. A
    combination of new laws, a brief but powerful confluence of international
    interests, and most importantly, a geographically dispersed scale of violence
    unprecedented in human history gave rise to a collection of both international
    and national war crimes tribunals which confronted the horrors of war and
    occupation, for the most part, in the name of humanity. Flawed though they were
    and criticized by some as mere exercises in victor's justice, no one can deny
    their impact on the entire postwar development of international humanitarian
    law, the rise of human rights discourse, and the birth of transitional justice
    as a distinct realm of political activism, legal innovation and academic
    debate. If these early postwar trials, from Nuremberg to Tokyo and from Norway
    to the Philippines invoked a universalist vocabulary, the accused were limited,
    for the most part, to the citizens of a relatively small number of recognized
    aggressor nations. That the triumphant Allies did not supply suspects for these
    trials from their own ranks has been often noted, but it was Allied bomber
    pilots and Soviet foot soldiers whose presence were most sorely missed by
    critics. Less attention was given by contemporaries and historians since to the
    nationals of occupied lands who perpetrated atrocities in the service of the
    occupier. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;"Minion Pro"'>Few marked the absence in
    the great postwar tribunals of Chinese or Burmese soldiers who fought side by side
    with Japanese forces, or argued that Korean and Indian police who helped
    torture fellow Koreans or Malayan prisoners might belong together with the
    accused guards of prisoner of war camps. Many of the crimes that these allies
    of the defeated powers could have been charged with such as torture, rape,
    arson, murder and massacre, differed little from those committed by the mostly
    German and Japanese combatants tried as war criminals. Around the world the
    fate of most of these local nationals was determined by a different set of
    rules, and their crimes were condemned and remembered within the bounds of a
    radically different political discourse. With some important exceptions, most
    of these forgotten “war criminals” were merged into the much larger category of
    collaborator, and potentially charged with the highest crime of nations:
    treason. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;"Minion Pro"'>These atrocities of treason
    were more frequently interpreted by wartime resistance members and early
    postwar regimes as expressions of their betrayal rather than simple barbarity;
    their violence was seen as an affirmation of their adherence to a despised
    enemy rather than a rejection of human dignity. Thus anchoring their crimes in
    the mental realms of fidelity and treachery, two seemingly contradictory
    approaches emerged: the attempt to punish the atrocities of collaborators
    within the highly political domain of treason prosecutions and an alternative
    approach that emphasized the reformability of these otherwise valuable human
    resources who had been poisoned by their association with the enemy. This
    dissertation examines this peculiar politics of retribution in several areas
    affected by Japanese occupation: the British Empire in Asia, the Philippines,
    and Shandong, China. </span></p>

    relationship between the crimes of betrayal and occupation violence developed
    against a complex backdrop of anti-colonial struggle or civil war. In every
    case there was a clear tendency to separate out military and police forces that
    supported the Japanese wartime empire from other accused traitors.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> While these were the collaborators who were the most likely to have been
    complicit in atrocities during the course of occupations and war, they were
    also usually the most numerous in number, and thus both more useful and
    dangerous to postwar regimes. In some late colonial settings such as India and
    Burma, these wartime forces were also potentially admired for their
    anti-colonial credentials.<a href="#_ftn2"

    for their wartime treason were either abandoned or, more often, transformed
    into far smaller-scale treason trials for only those who were accused of
    atrocities. The fact that these proceedings that punished crimes of violence
    remained within a broader process of retribution against treason and, in the
    case of the Philippines, some special characteristics of the treason law
    itself, made this an even more flawed environment in which to punish the crimes
    of war than the various imperfect war crimes trials for enemy nationals that
    were being carried out at the same time. Finally, efforts to reform and
    reintegrate thousands of members of these forces, including the Indian National
    Army, the Burma National Army, the Philippine Bureau of Constabulary, and
    various Chinese armies who fought for Japan were aided by the portrayal of
    their crimes primarily as a form of curable disease, or else as victims of
    deception who could purge their treason with patriotic acts of penitence.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup> <sup><span

    of retribution after the Second World War had transnational and global

    seeks to open new avenues of discovery by highlighting the impact and costs of
    the particular ways in which the atrocities of war were addressed by resistance

"Minion Pro"'>Much of the retribution before and after the
    final days of the Second World War was in the form of summary justice. These
    acts of revenge were against individuals, suspect groups, or whole communities.
    They were carried out by members of organized resistance forces, by victims,
    and their relatives. In other cases, suspected collaborators may have thought
    their own wartime conduct would be forgotten if they joined the orgy of
    retributive violence. Retribution of this kind could often mask a grab for
    political power, or even more often, personal or family strife. It could be
    carried out without inconvenient court records, witness testimony, or the
    rebuttal of the accused. These extra-judicial killings are notoriously
    difficult to study. Through anecdotal evidence, historians have determined the
    fact that retributive violence was comparatively common in France, and less so
    in the Netherlands; rare in southern Korea, but on a terrifying scale in
    British Malaya. However, usable statistics are almost non-existent, and chasing
    these claims to their footnotes often yield a few diaries as evidence for
    generalizations covering highly diverse regions. </span></p>

    motivations behind the violence poses an even bigger challenge. Studies
    strongly rooted in a locality that take into account the complex web of

    this kind of widely dispersed violence after war, and these are still few in

    but for the most part, this work will focus on the politics of retribution

    momentous transitions which accompanied Japan’s collapse in 1945 are what unite
    the chapters of this work. When I speak of treason, for the most part it is
    treason in the form of a collaboration with Japanese military forces. When I
    speak of violence, in greater measure, I refer to the violence committed in the
    context of Japanese occupations or the continuities in that violence following
    the end of those occupations. However, the anchoring role played by the
    expansion and collapse of the Japanese empire in this dissertation is in one
    sense deceptive. The politics of retribution in each chapter overlaps
    significantly with scholarship deeply informed by three themes in which the
    Japanese empire plays a very different role: 1) the response to Western

    experience, and 3) the development of agrarian revolutions and the emergence of

    the Japanese Army continued to weaken Chinese sovereignty in northern China
    through a policy of supporting autonomous breakaway administrations. After the
    outbreak of a full scale Sino-Japanese war in 1937, when temporarily united
    Communist and Nationalist Chinese forces refused to allow further encroachment,
    Japanese forces soon found themselves deeply mired in a bloody stalemate.
    American pressure, including a full oil embargo, forced Japan to make a choice
    between a humiliating retreat or a preemptive attack to cripple the U.S. Navy
    and capture the resource rich colonies of Southeast Asia. The rapid “southern
    advance” of the Japanese military beginning in December, 1941 swept aside the
    colonial governments of Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. It completed
    Japanese dominance in French Indochina, subjected a weak, if independent Thai
    regime, and overthrew a Philippine Commonwealth waiting for its promised
    independence from the United States. In British India, following a failed
    attempt to reach a compromise with leading Indian nationalists to secure
    support for British war efforts at the nadir of Allied fortunes in August,
    1942, the Indian National Congress launched a “Quit India” movement. The
    movement called for an immediate end to colonial rule and colonial authorities
    responded with a massive round-up of nationalist leaders that led to a powerful
    outbreak of urban and later rural violence.</span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>For historians of empire in South and
    Southeast Asia as well as of the nation-states that emerged following
    decolonization, the Pacific War from 1941 to 1945 is an important, if brief,
    transitional moment which serves primarily to inform a narrative of the fall of
    Western imperialism. In the historiography of Japanese empire, however, these
    final years of expansion were a desperate attempt by the empire to preserve
    itself but, even more, a culminating moment of experimentation. This took place
    at a time when, across the wartime empire, every last resource was being
    extracted, forced labor conscripted on a mass scale, and counter-insurgency
    campaigns were growing more and more desperate. Nevertheless, historians have
    seen this as a moment when alternative Japanese visions for a new political and
    cultural order in Asia came at least one step closer to the promises of
    propaganda. Japanese military leaders sometimes supported the anti-colonial
    aspirations found throughout Southeast Asia. As defeat loomed, occupation
    governments increasingly backed this support with limited devolutions of power,
    including nominal independence for Burma and the Philippines in 1943. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>This experience, especially in Southeast
    Asia, left a complex legacy. The costs and consequences of trying murder,
    torture, and complicity in wartime atrocities through treason trials and other
    special collaboration tribunals in the early postwar period varied around the
    world, as did the movements to reform and reintegrate military and police
    collaborators. At the very least, however, trying individuals for atrocities
    under the laws of treason in a colonial context posed a particularly troubling
    phenomenon. It was not merely a question of whether the accused could be
    expected to maintain wartime loyalty towards their imperial masters. The
    hypocrisy became particularly glaring in these cases since the treasonous sins
    were committed in the context of what many saw as a <i>foreign occupation of a
    foreign occupation</i>. Every moment spent emphasizing the horrors of the
    one&#8212;that of the Japanese, could not but help remind everyone of the
    existence of the other&#8212;British, French, Dutch, or American colonial rule,
    even if the scale of violence and devastation was greater in one than in the
    other. The effects of the <i>double occupations </i>of Asia had a strong impact
    on the local response both during the war and in the politics of the aftermath
    of Japan’s defeat.</span></p>

    occupations and the Pacific War&#8211;the Japanese occupation as a deviation
    from, or catalyst in, a longer story of decolonization on the one hand, and a
    Japan-centered story that considers the wartime empire as the final rise and
    fall of certain pan-Asian ambitions on the other, both give rise to two
    questions of influence that have received much attention. The first asks what
    impact Japanese occupations and the war with Western empires had upon existing
    anti-colonial movements and the end of colonialism throughout the region. The
    second asks what, if any, Japanese occupation institutions and ideas developed
    in this period may have contributed to the formation of the post-colonial
    nation-state. Both of these are important questions, but answers to them have
    often been limited to studying networks of like-minded individuals,
    institutional histories, and high politics. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>If anything, this dissertation returns to an
    emphasis on the role of violence. Almost everywhere the Japanese imperial army
    advanced, atrocities and brutality followed, with the scale of physical
    violence multiplying as Japan’s fortunes faltered and resistance grew. The
    temporary alliances between anti-colonial forces and Japanese occupation armies
    should not be recalled without also recalling their complicity in the violence
    of those occupations, even as the repression of the Western colonial rule they
    sought to overthrow is recognized. Similarly, when evaluating the lasting
    influence of Japanese occupation period institutions, it is worth considering
    the fate of security organs that helped to maintain those occupations, and the
    individuals who carried out its brutal tasks. At the same time, the differences
    between the areas of “double occupation” in Southeast Asia, and the emerging
    postwar societies of China, Taiwan, and Korea must also be taken into account.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>In the historiography of Japan’s own
    colonial empire, the issue of postwar continuities of violence has received
    extensive consideration, no more so than in studies on Korea. Often this
    discussion builds upon an understanding of a particularly Japanese form of
    colonialism. Unlike the short occupations of Southeast Asia beginning with the
    rapid advances of 1941, or the decade and a half of encroachment and military
    occupation in China from 1931, Japan’s colonial rule in Okinawa, Karafuto
    (South Sakhalin), Taiwan, and Korea stretched across multiple decades and
    included an evolving policy of assimilation tailored to the circumstances of
    each. These colonies were in close proximity to the Japanese archipelago and
    were often tied in deep and complex ethnic and cultural relationships with the
    metropole. Scholarship on Japanese colonial history, as with studies of Russian
    imperialism, has often focused upon its unique characteristics and contrasted
    it with the more frequently juxtaposed empires of France, Britain, and the
    Netherlands. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>If the wars of Japanese expansion are
    embedded in narratives of the fall of western imperialism in South and
    Southeast Asia, or its organs of repression analyzed in the context of a
    uniquely Japanese colonial experience, in another body of scholarship,
    including the rich historiography on the rise of the Chinese Communist Party,
    the experience of Japanese occupation is primarily considered in its role as a
    catalyst for revolution. To a greater or lesser extent, this is true across the
    former Japanese empire. The massive social disruption of Japanese military
    expansion, its relatively weak control beyond urban centers of power, and its
    sudden demise all facilitated the rise of powerful rural revolutionary
    movements that frequently married calls for agrarian reform with calls for
    national liberation. If anti-colonial forces sometimes sought to benefit from a
    “pact with the devil,” and cooperated with Japanese occupiers, others such as
    the Chinese and Malaysian Communists, the Philippine Hukbalahap, the Viet Minh,
    and even Korean guerrillas in Manchuria developed valuable military and
    political experience in the course of their resistance against it.
    Unsurprisingly, they also refined their own organs of strict discipline and
    carried out widespread liquidation of enemies justified by a quasi-permanent
    state of crisis. In these narratives, however, Japan serves as what one might
    call a <i>repressive constant</i>. When Japan is defeated, the role of this
    constant source of repressive violence is merely swapped out and fulfilled by
    the reactionary regime that is established in its place: the Nationalist regime
    in China, the Philippine oligarchy, a US supported right-wing regime in
    southern Korea, or returning French and British empires, thus justifying the
    continued challenge to the state posed by the wartime insurgency. For these
    revolutionary organizations as well as many sympathetic to their cause, the
    taint of treason serves well when hard evidence of specific atrocities or other
    acts of overt oppression are not at hand. </span></p>

    issues brought up in this introduction. It begins with a discussion of the
    problematic term “collaboration” and some of the costs of adopting it as a
    framework of research. Instead, this dissertation disaggregates the two primary
    aspects of acts typically referred to by collaboration, violence and betrayal.
    The remainder of the chapter provides a broader global overview of the efforts
    to punish war crimes after the Second World War, and the ways in which military
    and police allies of the defeated powers were dealt with in Europe. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>This is followed by three chapters,
    composing Part One of the dissertation, which examine the British Empire’s
    approach to treason and acts of brutality or other forms of illegitimate
    violence. British policy towards its “Indian renegades,” especially the Indian
    National Army that fought with the Japanese on the Burmese front, began with an
    attempt to treat its traitors like men afflicted with a contagious disease, and
    later evolved into an ambitious policy of mass trials. As widespread opposition
    to the trials became evident, the thousands of initially planned cases were
    gradually scaled down and transformed into trials limited to military collaborators
    with Japan who were also accused of atrocities, especially against British or
    Indian POWs. This attempt failed with violent consequences within the Indian
    subcontinent as the trials sparked protests, riots, and even helped inspire a
    naval mutiny. Despite the shift to focus on atrocities, the most famous opening
    trial not only retained the highly political crime of treason to deliver a
    symbolic ruling on the treasonous nature of the Indian National Army, but was
    among the weakest cases in terms of evidence for accusations of prisoner murder
    and abuse. Thanks to the failures of this initial trial and the tremendous
    response it inspired, the belated focus on the brutality of some INA soldiers
    utterly failed to persuade India that the effort was anything more than a dying
    empire’s feeble attempt to tarnish one branch of the Indian independence
    movement. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>&nbsp;Chapter Three traces the impact of the
    evolving British response to the Indian National Army on the cases of many
    other former British imperial subjects who were guilty of more troubling crimes
    throughout the Empire, including other “Indian renegades” who helped maintain
    Japanese military occupations far away from the potential glories of the
    India-Burma front. In British Malaya, Borneo, Hong Kong, and Singapore, the
    decision was made to follow the Indian example and limit cases of treason to
    those which included atrocities, with an exception for the case of informers.
    While in principle this might have had the laudable effect of creating a direct
    parallel to the war crimes tribunals of Japanese soldiers being carried out
    throughout British Asia, the effect was more to further weaken a process which
    was already low on the priority list for colonial officials. Little detailed
    evidence of atrocities had been gathered on the hundreds of suspected traitors
    in custody, whose disloyalty alone was initially sufficient to secure their
    conviction. The chapter closes by considering the fate of one other group of “Indian
    renegades” beyond the subcontinent, some of whom faced no mercy at the hand of
    a vengeful French resistance.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The fourth chapter turns to the case of
    Burma, where another treasonous army, the Burma National Army, rebelled against
    the Japanese in time to redeem itself partially in the eyes of the returning
    British officials. The chapter contrasts the policies of American
    Counter-Intelligence Corps agents, who pursued Burmese collaborators deep into
    the jungles of northern Burma, with a returning British administration again
    considering large scale trials for military collaborators&#8211;first for
    treason and later only for those accused of atrocities. In Burma, the issue was
    further complicated by the particularly strong ethnic divisions that sometimes
    shaped wartime violence. Leaving these issues unresolved, the entire process
    was completely derailed largely thanks to a single inconvenient murder
    accusation against a traitor-turned-ally who was too important to surrender to
    trial: Aung San.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>Part two of the dissertation shifts away
    from the British Empire to look at political retribution against military
    collaborators in the Philippines. Chapter Five outlines the forms of military
    collaboration with the Japanese occupation in the Philippines and introduces
    the ways in which the collaboration issue has been framed in postwar Philippine
    memory. Historical accounts of the trials of retribution against these
    individuals usually come to an abrupt end in 1948 with the proclamation of a
    presidential amnesty and the dismantling of the special People’s Courts
    established to try collaboration cases. However, this chapter takes a closer
    look at the debate in the Philippine legislature over treason trials that ended
    in the confirmation of the amnesty, which excluded cases of military
    collaborators and informers. While those accused in cases not covered by the
    amnesty were directly responsible for some of the most violent acts of the
    occupation, the structure of the amnesty had the unsettling result of allowing
    almost all elites&#8211;including those who had power over the security organs
    that supported the Japanese occupation&#8211;to go unpunished. Meanwhile,
    treason trials continued in regular criminal courts for the mostly rural and
    lower class collaborators who worked in closest proximity with Japanese
    soldiers and military police in their brutal counterinsurgency campaigns.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The next chapter argues that the highly
    political crime of treason was most unsuited to punishing war crimes of
    Filipinos guilty of acts ranging from serving as informants, killing civilians,
    participating in massacres, or coercing women into sexual slavery for the
    Japanese military. Crimes of violence committed in the context of treason were,
    under rules for “complex crimes,” held to the higher requirements for a treason
    conviction. On the other hand, some individuals were found guilty on
    determination of their membership in organizations alone, while others, such as
    many accused Philippine constabulary members, were seen as merely carrying out
    their policing duties, even if these were under guidance of the Japanese
    military. Finally, in cases in which Filipinos helped to secure sex slaves for
    the Japanese military, their crime was not seen as sufficiently “political in
    nature” to merit conviction as treason, while other acts of violence and
    coercion qualified. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The third and final part of the dissertation
    shifts to focus greater attention on efforts to reform and make use of those
    who had been reviled and hated for their role in preserving oppressive Japanese
    occupations. This approach was carried out throughout the areas already covered
    in previous chapters, though the scale and leniency employed in the efforts
    differed from case to case. Before the shift to a strategy of prosecution, most
    captured members Indian National Army were either directly redeployed or given
    an opportunity to be cured of their treason in a “holiday camp.” Thousands of
    rehabilitated military collaborators of Burma were allowed to join a new
    postwar Burmese Army on the eve of independence, and most Philippine Bureau of
    Constabulary members were merged into the postwar constabulary after passing
    “loyalty boards,” with little effort made to determine their role in wartime
    atrocities.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The final chapter looks at a particularly
    elaborate campaign to secure the wartime defection of military collaborators
    carried out by the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong province. The Party
    portrayed its Nationalist competitor as riddled with the remnants of military
    “puppets” who fought side by side with the Japanese. However, the Party
    separated its own “traitor elimination” efforts from its “enemy and puppet
    work” in order to recruit and redeploy the universally reviled military
    collaborators. The policy of extreme leniency for the poorly trained and poorly
    armed client armies supporting the Japanese occupation wavered around the time
    of Japanese surrender. Some military collaborators unlucky enough to surrender
    or be captured in this transitional period found themselves caught up in a
    violent campaign of mass retribution against traitors. </span></p>

    not about the moral dilemmas of collaboration. It is about a politics of retribution
    in which atrocities are punished as treason. Because it is difficult to speak
    of the latter without some reference to the former, we must begin with a
    discussion of that term which, more than any other, stands in the way of the
    goal of this project. Collaboration is one of those concepts which, like the
    serpent Ouroboros, circles the world only to devour itself. The more one
    pursues it, the greater the struggle to prevent it from dissipating completely
    as a useful category of analysis. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>A growing body of scholarship that addresses collaboration as a
    historical phenomenon often rests upon a form of equivocation, alternately
    employing the term with one meaning and then another. The most common way this
    is done is to begin with a specific definition of collaboration as the
    provision of aid to a foreign occupier, but then elsewhere employ the term in a
    more general way to describe acts which make one complicit in the violence or
    oppression of any authority. An illustration of this kind of move is found in a
    2012 series of exchanges in the <i>Journal of Asian Studies </i>on the ethics
    of collaboration between John Whittier Treat, Timothy Brook, and Michael D.
    Shin.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[7]</span></sup></sup></a> The
    main historical cases that each focus upon are colonial Korea and
    Japanese-occupied China. In his opening piece on an important Korean literary
    figure who energetically supported the Japanese empire, Yi Kwang-su, Treat
    introduces us to a wide world of collaboration from the literary to the
    philosophical, and from the pedagogic to the political. Broadly speaking, there
    are two kinds of collaboration portrayed: one that occupies a universal moral
    domain of action and one which is tied to a particular form of illegitimate
    relationship with an Other. An example of the first is found in his quoting of
    Milan Kundera’s definition of collaboration, “putting oneself voluntarily at
    the service of a vile power,” and Kundera’s observation that, “we realize more
    and more that man’s activity is by nature a collaboration.”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[8]</span></sup></sup></a> This
    is a universal collaboration: a sin we all bear when our actions as well as our
    inaction make us complicit with the crimes of the state or, for example, the
    injustices of an economic order we help sustain. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>However, in choosing a Korean figure such as Yi who argued for
    complete assimilation with Japan and supported its wartime empire, Treat notes
    that “collaboration and its associated moral morass recede as an
    issue&#8212;how does one collaborate with oneself?”<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[9]</span></sup></sup></a> Here
    is a collaboration tied to identity; a moral morass that is dependent upon the
    distinction between the collaborator and the power served.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[10]</span></sup></sup></a> Treat’s solution is to turn to the ethical theories of the analytic philosophy
    tradition, using a consequentialist approach to pass judgment on Yi’s choice to
    write passionate appeals on behalf of the imperial cause. This approach,
    however, offers nothing to distinguish the class of immoral acts Yi commits
    from those of, say, a Japanese colonial official in Korea, or a novelist in
    rural Japan who calls upon the youth of the countryside to sacrifice their
    lives for the nation. Are they not all putting themselves at the service of a
    vile power? Do their actions not lead to negative consequences? </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The only meaningful way to distinguish their acts from those of
    Yi in Treat’s moral mechanics is to privilege a loyalty to someone or
    something, most often the nation. Timothy Brook points this out in his response
    to Treat, which argues that collaboration is a troublesome lens for moral
    reflection. It continues to depend, “for its conceptual coherence” on
    nationalism. It was nationalism which had demanded, “a new concept redolent of
    improper liaisons and denied parentage, and collaboration became nationalism’s
    evil twin.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"
title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[11]</span></sup></sup></a> Brook’s
    alternative, seen in his own study of local collaboration in occupied China is
    not, however, the universal collaboration with evil that Kundera describes. The
    sense of an “improper liaison” does not completely disappear when the term’s
    connection to the nation-state is severed. In his careful attempts to
    disentangle the strands of complicity, contingency, and unexpected outcomes in
    the specific cases of individuals, the unique positionality of a collaborator
    in an occupation setting is repeatedly emphasized. Indeed, Brook defines
    collaboration itself narrowly, following the Danish historian Henrik
    Dethlefsen, as the “continuing exercise of power” while under the coercion of
    an occupying force.<a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[12]</span></sup></sup></a> While avoiding any attachment of weight to national loyalty, the collaborator
    is described as caught in a “parasitic political engagement produced by the
    cancellation of sovereignty” and faced with the usually hopeless task of
    bridging the gap between the illegitimate occupation state and the occupied
    population.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"

  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>This is still something very distinct from the presumably more
    natural engagement between, for example the Japanese civilians employed in
    “pacification teams” throughout occupied China and the Japanese military with
    which they worked. If the <i>Chinese</i> identity of the collaborator was not
    relevant, their state of <i>occupation</i> was. The historian of German and
    Soviet occupied Poland, Jan T. Gross, also emphasizes this context, concluding
    that, “inasmuch as it denotes a set of relationships between the occupiers and
    the occupied <i>mediated by a set of officially existing institutions</i>,
    collaboration must be an occupier-driven phenomenon.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[14]</span></sup></sup></a> For
    Gross, what made collaboration a unique part of a Second World War Europe host
    to the Holocaust was a different sort of gap: the one which opened up between
    the tolerable “terms of initial commitment” made by the collaborator to the
    occupation state, and the terrifying end result.<a
href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[15]</span></sup></sup></a> We
    might call these two similar approaches to collaboration, which endeavor to
    carefully sever the connection with issues of identity and betrayal in order to
    highlight the unique challenges faced by a population under foreign domination, <i>occupation-collaboration</i>. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>As the gaps described by Gross and Brook suggest, emphasizing the
    positionality of individuals operating under foreign occupation allows the
    historian to focus in upon the devastating impact of international wars and the
    jarring spectacle of an invaded people engaging at deep disadvantage with a
    completely new set of powerful actors. Depending on the object of one’s
    research, this approach can serve well, but it can also come at a cost. Hilary
    Conroy pointed out some of these problems long ago. He suggested, as does Treat
    for the Korean case, that collaboration has a very awkward place at the table
    in a mid-twentieth century Asia full of colonies. Even without taking the
    problem of identity into account, the colonial setting strains the term
    occupation, and leaves the discussion in “shambles.” For Conroy, this problem
    emerges from the fact that the phenomenon of collaboration is so deeply rooted
    in the experiences of the Second World War, and specifically its “Nazi-European
    context.”<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"
title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[16]</span></sup></sup></a></span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>Beyond the difficulty of applying its use to colonial contexts, a
    problem we will revisit below, occupation-collaboration runs into difficulty
    when applied to earlier historical examples that long predate the rise of the
    modern nation-state. Despite the fact almost every piece on collaboration
    refers to the emergence of this term in 1940, when the French Marshal Pétain
    announced his collaboration with the German occupiers, any claim that the acts
    collaboration refer to are distinctly modern is an exercise in pure tautology.
    Historians of ancient Chinese and Greek history can supply many examples. And
    yet, attempts to explore these older cases and their moral dilemmas without
    serious consideration of community identity and the sense of betrayal of, for
    example, a group of oligarchs who open the city gates to an invading army, is
    to miss something absolutely central about the way the event was perceived and
    remembered by its contemporaries. Just as a historian acknowledges the
    normative principles that guide them in the formulation of their questions and
    the whole course of their approach, we must also recognize the gap this creates
    between us and the subjects we write about. We are no less bound than the moral
    philosopher addressed by Judith Shklar in her memorable appeal, </span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>No theory of either justice or injustice can
    be complete if it does not take account of the sense of injustice. It is,
    indeed, one of the failings of the normal model of justice that it does not do
    so. It does not give injustice its due because it does not consider the
    sentiments that make us cry out for revenge, and if that is denied, for justice.
    Too complacent, it forgets the irrationality, fear, indifference and inequality
    which give injustice its power.<a href="#_ftn17"

  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>What of the postwar period? There have been military occupations
    since 1945, and both Iraqi and Afghan collaborators await anxiously today to
    see what the future has in store for them, but it seems strangely arbitrary to
    limit the term collaboration to the relatively small number of foreign
    invasions in the second half of the twentieth century, when so many other cases
    seem to produce similar moral dilemmas. Is the long Communist interlude in
    Eastern Europe only to be incorporated into debates over collaboration because
    it included a Soviet military occupation? Why not speak of collaboration in the
    context of brutal civil wars where there is no truly foreign occupier? What of
    collaboration with a newly formed military dictatorship that has retained an
    existing bureaucracy? What of collaboration with American empire? Finally, why
    not include our persistent inaction in the face of social injustice?<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[18]</span></sup></sup></a> The
    problem is, of course, that each broader category of cases we include brings us
    closer to Kundera’s understanding of the collaborator as a universal archetype:
    the reluctant or enthusiastic accomplice, the fellow if subordinate
    conspirator, the complicit bystander; the guilty and the damned.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>In many of these cases we find something similar to the gap
    between the occupied and a state that lacks or has lost all legitimacy. We also
    often find a terrible contrast between the “terms of initial commitment” and
    the final result, even if this contrast rarely, if it ever can, rises to the
    scale of horror found in the Holocaust. Most importantly, in each case that
    includes oppression and atrocity the historian must, as in the case of military
    occupations, consider the complicity of actors who may themselves have directly
    carried out crimes, indirectly facilitated them, or whose inaction might be
    judged unforgivable. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>Now, though, the dissipation is near complete, and the word
    collaboration simply becomes another word for moral complicity. If
    collaboration is almost everywhere, and in such a wide range of contexts, it
    fails to capture something distinct that a more restrictive, if arbitrary,
    definition of occupation-collaboration offered. It is something that is always
    there in occupation-collaboration, nagging the historian from behind. It is
    something occupation-collaboration yields not because of the virtue of its
    conceptual integrity but because all of the cases it does include share the
    very thing it sought to remove from consideration in the first place: betrayal. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>This brings us full circle. When Philippe Pétain used the word
    “collaboration” to describe a defeated France’s new relationship with Germany, that
    term stood out so memorably because it was widely seen as an attempt to conceal
    a vile act of treason as an innocuous partnership. The Western world was
    witness not to the birth of a new concept but a new deceit, a new euphemism for
    infidelity which only gradually spread in use beyond French and English. It is
    true that the “conceptual coherence” of the term collaboration depended on
    nationalism, but it was more than that. Its ability to stand in for treason
    served Pétain, the resistance, and historians alike. It replaced an ancient set
    of words denoting betrayal with a modern and international alternative. In the
    decades since the war, with nationalism in the dock and the focus shifted to an
    accounting of the unparalleled violence of the Second World War, the wartime
    traitors could be condemned again under a new indictment. Even so, it has never
    gained full global currency as a concept. Its equivalent words in other
    languages have not played a central role in the debates in many of the
    countries grappling with wartime crimes.<a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[19]</span></sup></sup></a> Indeed, it appears only rarely in the sources used throughout this
    dissertation, even when those sources were composed in English. Though the term
    collaboration continues to spread, in many places, the discussion remains now,
    as it did then, for the most part unashamedly about treason, or other nouns
    identifying the perpetrators of national betrayal. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>In sum, collaboration obscures more than it explains. Attempts to
    preserve its contextuality trap the historian in a nationalist or at least
    identity-centric frame. Attempts to escape this frame result in a
    still-normatively-loaded concept that is either generalized to the point of
    uselessness, or arbitrarily confined to the very contexts that defined the
    original frame. Instead of using the framework of collaboration, this
    dissertation considers the relationship between the two core components that
    has driven so much of what has been written on the topic: betrayal and the
    sense of an illicit relationship on the one hand, and complicity in oppression
    and atrocity on the other. The outpouring of retributive violence and calls for
    justice in the aftermath of Japanese surrender in 1945 that are the primary
    consideration in this dissertation cannot be explained without considering
    both. Most important of all, however, a focus upon the relationship <i>between</i> the two allows us to treat post-liberation societies not merely as dramatically
    transformed environments&#8212;though this is not to underestimate the
    importance of this break, but as environments that often posed challenges
    similar to occupation period itself. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>I have not removed the word collaborator everywhere it makes its
    appearance in this dissertation. It remains one convenient word among several
    used in the chapters that follow to distinguish a group of actors who are, at
    various points, accused of treason or violent crimes. If I seem cavalier in
    calling individuals renegades, traitors, puppets, and the like, following their
    accusers, it is because these characters are not the main protagonists of this
    story. This is the other sense in which this dissertation is not about
    collaboration: it is not the moral dilemmas and crimes of those who aided the
    Japanese occupations which are the main concern in what follows. They are of
    course important, but in this study of the politics of retribution, the focus
    is upon the judges and their relationship with the accused, not upon the
    accused and their relationship to the victims.</span></p>

    leaders. The main emphasis of both trials was the prosecution of leading
    figures of the defeated powers accused of crimes against peace. Both of these
    international tribunals were supplemented by national-level trials or military
    tribunals involving thousands of suspects accused of conventional war crimes
    and crimes against humanity throughout Europe and Asia. In the case of the

    conquest and, wherever they could, established occupations that ignored the
    laws of civilization. In Europe, article six of the London Charter of 8 August,

"Minion Pro"'>In most countries across Europe military and police forces that
    worked with wartime occupations came in closest contact with their violence and
    repression. Every day they faced a choice of whether to participate in that
    violence, facilitate it, ignore it, or suffer the consequences of a bolder
    alternative. These were moral choices they faced, just as German soldiers and
    Gestapo officers faced them. However, in the aftermath of war military and
    police collaborators were judged not solely upon whether they committed torture
    or facilitated massacre. They were judged on whether they arrested insurgents <i>for </i>the occupier; whether they committed torture <i>on behalf</i> of the
    Germans; and whether they facilitated massacres <i>by </i>the enemy. Their
    crimes almost never stood alone and were linked closely to their betrayal. In
    the territories that emerged from the grip of Japan’s wartime empire that are
    the focus in this dissertation, we find a similar pattern in the response of
    postwar regimes, even when it was a returning empire. The atrocities committed
    by nationals of the occupied territories almost always became deeply
    intertwined with the efforts to punish betrayal of the nation.<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><sup> <sup><span

    because of the persistence of the broader concept of collaboration, and behind

    of the following chapters examines some of the consequences of taking this

"Minion Pro"'>Beyond the immediate costs, however, was a longer legacy.
    Whatever their faults, war crimes trials sent a clear message that certain
    forms of conduct were no longer tolerable and lacked all legitimacy. Neither
    the Allies with their bloody hands, or those who pointed out their hypocrisy at
    the time fundamentally opposed the basic principles established. If atrocities,
    tortures, and though less common, outright invasions continued to be prominent
    features of the second half of the century, they did so in the shadow of a
    powerful international human rights discourse that would come to full maturity
    in the 1980s. One of the tragedies of retribution in the name of treason after
    Japan’s defeat in Asia, as well as in Europe, was that this declaration of the
    fundamental illegitimacy of torture, summary execution, and mass atrocity was
    not <i>amplified</i> in the domestic setting where the nationals of each
    country were tried. Insofar as the primary crime was that of betrayal, it was
    that much easier to come away from the war, as some surely did, with the view
    that resistance forces, or postwar successor states continued to be bound by a
    simpler logic within the realm of civil conflict. Our torture is justifiable,
    our prisoners do not deserve protection, and our liquidations are
    necessary&#8212;if only the nation is saved.</span></p>

    “renegades” of the British Empire who fought together with the Japanese. It examines
    the evolving efforts to punish mostly military collaborators in India and
    Burma, and the impact of policy established in India upon the broader
    retributive process in Southeast Asia after the war. In all of these cases, the
    people of the invaded territories emerged at the end of the conflict not as a
    people free and self-determined, but instead were turned over once again to
    their old imperial ruler, Britain. As we shall see, this impacted both the
    wartime choices of nationalist leaders from each of Britain’s colonies, as well
    as the postwar response of the returning empire. </span></a></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The claims that treason charges in this
    complex environment was unjust was not unique to margins of empire. The
    European attempts to punish military and police collaborators through the laws
    of national betrayal that we saw in the previous chapter occasionally had to
    deal with treason suspects who could protest they owed no allegiance to the
    country they were accused of betraying. Accused traitors of German origin could
    make this claim. Minorities in the Soviet Union such as the Cossacks and
    Ukrainians could make this claim, as did ethnic Bulgarians in Greece, Croatians
    in Yugoslavia, the Flemish in Belgium, and many others. Britain’s most famous
    wartime traitor, the radio broadcaster for the Nazis, William Joyce, pleaded
    that he may have been Irish or American but was never a British citizen, and
    thus owed no loyalty to the King. It did not save him from the gallows. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>However, in India and Burma, the returning
    British did not face the pleas of a few marginal figures, or minority group
    traitors who could do little to threaten the state. It faced powerful and
    growing nationalist sentiment at the same time as its control over territories
    had weakened to the point of breaking. In India and Burma, the British
    attempted to limit trials of collaborators only to those who were both traitors
    and guilty of other violent crimes. In both cases, they failed to achieve the
    political aims of the process as well as any meaningful reckoning with wartime
    atrocities. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>In India the vast reduction in the number of
    cases considered did not prevent early postwar trials from becoming a powerful
    nationalist issue to rally behind. In Burma the British learned from the
    lessons of India. It abandoned virtually all attempts to try military
    collaborators guilty of atrocities but offered nothing in its place to address
    the bitterness of wartime violence that often bore a complex ethnic character.
    The attempt to link treason to brutality in India, Burma, and throughout the
    British empire offered no model as an alternative means to punish wartime
    atrocities by Japan’s allies. In India, the British produced no convictions of
    INA suspects who were guilty of the crimes against civilians that could serve
    as helpful precedents in cases elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Instead, with the
    exception of some violence against Indian POWs that had not joined the INA, their
    crimes were usually carried out in the name of internal military discipline
    and, in some cases, would not even have constituted offenses if they had been
    carried out under British orders. In Burma, where the British had evidence of
    atrocities by the former Burma Independence Army, including their leader Aung
    San, the decision to save the latter crippled any efforts to continue with
    prosecutions. Even had this case not imploded the effort, from the start the
    entire approach to the process was marred by a fatal distortion: by using the
    issue of atrocities as a means to legitimize limited retribution against those
    who were disloyal, the search became one for traitors who were also
    incidentally guilty of atrocities, with all the domestic political ramifications
    such an effort bore, rather than as a more general independent process which
    aimed to find war criminals as such. </span></p>

    argued, the treatment of Taiwanese and Koreans on the same level with Japanese
    soldiers in war crimes trials elsewhere showed that the universal nature of the
    crime did not always sit comfortably with the contextual circumstances of the

    colonial subjects most threatened the empire’s wartime efforts, these men were
    treated as casualties affected by a temporary affliction. They could be
    restored to health with rest and an injection of patriotism. Only as Japanese
    defeat loomed was this lenient approach reversed and mass trials for treason
    proposed. When the number of those slated for trial were ultimately reduced to
    a small number of individuals also accused of wartime atrocities, it was still
    the charge of treason which hung over the entire proceedings. As the following

    collaborators from other accused traitors 2) a large scale attempt to reform
    military collaborators accused of treason 3) an ambitious plan to try wartime
    collaborators for treason that has its scope rapidly narrowed in the face of
    insurmountable political challenges 4) and a troubled attempt to prosecute

    decline. However, the accusations of treason in a colonial setting that appear
    so unjust to us today were not contested by British imperial officials of the
    time as inappropriate. If there was internal opposition to the prosecution of
    Indian independence activists who joined Britain’s wartime enemies, it was
    almost always a question of prudence. The crimes of violence that some INA
    officers were accused of, and other Indians who worked with the Japanese empire
    were guilty of are now easier for us to consider in isolation from the tense
    politics of decolonization of the time. At the time, however, accusations of
    murder and torture prosecuted in the small number of British trials of Indians
    after the war were not of the sort to elicit any significant indignation of the
    people of India. As we shall see, they rarely bore resemblance to the horror or
    scale of atrocities being reported from the various fronts of the war. Instead,

    and fit to fight. These were to be actively recruited as soldiers for the INA. 2)
    Sympathetic Indians who were not fit to fight. These were recruited into labor

    suddenly as the conclusion of the war neared. Exactly why this took place is a
    mystery that this dissertation is not able not resolve decisively. It might be
    argued that the policy changed because what was not possible before had become
    possible: during the war troops were needed for redeployment, and any potential
    risk to morale by mass punishment too great. This explanation is unconvincing,
    however, since the conclusion of the war brought even greater instability to
    the Indian subcontinent, not less. Wartime controls against subversive acts
    lost their justification with peace, and deferred calls for devolution of power
    would have to be answered by a substantially weakened empire. British colonial
    and cabinet officials did suggest that releasing INA soldiers would reward
    their disloyalty and compound this instability in the postwar period, but this
    new justification was not raised in documents from the military forces that
    were carrying out the categorization process in the forward interrogation
    centers themselves. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>Another explanation, which we will consider below in greater detail,
    lies with an increase in a desire for vengeance. Was the hardening of the
    policy due to a growing anger at the brutality of Indian collaborators with the
    Japanese toward Allied prisoners, a recognition of a hatred among soldiers who
    suffered heavy losses on the Burmese front, or Indian prisoners who contrasted
    their own suffering with the presumed benefits of the INA alternative? This
    accords with justifications produced at the time, but in materials I have
    found, the evidence for the breadth of these sentiments come from vague and
    indirect references by colonial officials, with only a few direct contemporary
    reports and later memoirs suggesting its severity. </span></p>

    release, redeployment, or treatment of treasonous “patients” to one which
    assigned more and more INA soldiers into the category of Blacks. This category
    was also increasingly described in terms of the eligibility of its members for
    future prosecution. This shift coincided with a separate re-categorization of
    all potentially threatening “Security Prisoners” carried out throughout India
    that usually had the opposite outcome. Thousands of cases of were being
    reviewed to determine their potential qualification for release at end of the
    war. These cases included such diverse individuals as detained Congress party
    politicians, Japanese agents and convicted terrorists. All Japanese and other
    enemy agents were to be released automatically at the close of the conflict,
    while others subject to preventive detention would become eligible for release.<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" title=""><sup> <sup><span

    regiments, warning of future threats. The commander expressed the view that any
    captured INA soldiers returned to their units would play the part of “good and

"Minion Pro"'>In a June letter by Philip Mason, the Joint Secretary to the War
    Department (India) who would become one of the key individuals in the formation
    of policy towards the INA, proposed three possibilities for handling the large
    numbers of INA soldiers coming into British hands: 1) they could be
    court-martialed whenever evidence was available but this would lead to a
    “considerable number of death sentences,” 2) a limited number could be allowed
    to stand for court-martial, with most sentences remitted or 3) all offenders
    could be treated lightly. Of these, the War Department favored the second
    option, “by which all Blacks against whom there is sufficient evidence would be
    brought to trial, and sentenced in accordance with the law,” though only severe
    cases would result in execution. At this point, the disloyalty of the INA soldiers
    was the primary consideration&#8211;there was no mention in the letter of the
    accusations of atrocities that would become central in the eventual trials.
    Mason noted that the lenient treatment accorded to the INA already amounted to
    a “whitewash” and that any limiting the scope of trials would allow “traitors”

    for INA Blacks was important but the hardening of British policy also extended
    to a reevaluation of the treatment of Grays. Solders who had until recently
    been returned to their units and treated as Whites without any stigma attached
    were now considered for harsher treatment. In a 6 August meeting between Indian
    Governor-General Archibald Wavell, Indian Army Commander-in-Chief Sir Claude
    Auchinleck, and Home and Finance members, everyone agreed that Grays should be
    discharged from the Indian Army, with the main point of disagreement being over
    whether they were to receive back pay for their time as prisoners of war. In
    his diary entry on the meeting, Governor-General Wavell recorded his strong
    opposition to the offering of back pay for traitorous soldiers, “I really could

    surrendered or captured significantly increased by Japan’s surrender. Among

"Minion Pro"'>The rapid increase in proportion of Blacks and the high number of
    proposed trials at this particular moment is puzzling. Those captured before
    the fall of Rangoon would likely have included most of the troops who, chosen
    by Subhas Chandra Bose for their martial ability and loyalty, were among the
    mere quarter or so of the INA forces who were actually deployed in the combat
    areas of western Burma at various points in 1944. It is reasonable to expect
    that forward-based forces comprised the most dedicated opponents to British
    rule as well as those who were likely to have had the opportunity to capture or
    kill Allied personnel in combat. On the other hand, with the exception of leading
    staff officers under Bose, it is hard to see how the thousands of INA personnel
    who surrendered around Rangoon, or the thousands of mostly
    “civilian”&#8212;that is those who were not Indian Army POWs&#8212;personnel of
    the 3rd INA division stationed in Malaya could include so many Black “hardened
    traitors.” These forces surrendered, for the most part, without a shot at
    Japan’s surrender in August, 1945. On the contrary, many of these Malayan
    Indians would not even be eligible for transportation to India in the first
    place. Whatever the logic behind the classification, these greatly enlarged
    numbers anchored the opening of an August, 1945 dialogue between officials over
    the establishment of a public policy on the trial of INA crimes. A debate began
    as a simple case of how to confront large-scale betrayal. Very soon, however, a
    process of peeling away categories of trial candidates began that would
    ultimately transform treason trials into trials for treasonous atrocities.</span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>Over the summer of 1945 leading up to Japanese surrender, the
    British Army produced an alarming number of INA Blacks for potential trial,
    reversing its earlier policy of leniency. Only at this late point was there any
    significant discussion of exactly what crime these men would be charged with,
    what sentences could be expected, and what the impact of the process might be.
    Only gradually would the discussion shift from one which focused upon the
    direct security threat posed by the INA to one which highlighted the supposed
    political consequences of tolerating disloyalty, and finally into a cause of
    justice which emphasized the brutality and violence of some INA soldiers.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>For some, the issue remained a simple question of security. The
    prospect of 600 estimated court-martials of INA soldiers as put forward by the
    Home and War departments of the Government of India and Burma on 11 August was
    immediately questioned by the Secretary of State for India and Burma, Frederick

  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>Pethick-Lawrence posed the question from the perspective of
    British wartime policy: the INA had posed a military risk that no longer
    existed after Japanese surrender. Just as many security prisoners, including
    some who had carried out or threatened violence against the Raj, were to be
    released throughout India, what harm was there in reclassifying and releasing
    the disarmed and demoralized remnants of the INA and the Indian Legion? The
    response to this challenge guided the course of debate that culminated in the
    handful of trials at the Red Fort in November and into the spring of 1946. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>Three general lines of argument justifying a stronger punitive
    response can be made out in the letters, conference notes and announcements of
    British government officials in the months to come. The security threat posed
    by the INA had indeed been, as Pethick-Lawrence suggested, “generally altered
    in character,” by the surrender, but according to some of his critics, this did
    not make the threat they posed any less serious. Colonial officials showed
    significant concern that leniency shown towards the INA would be perceived as
    weakness by any potentially disloyal elements within an Indian Army still
    deployed in the tens of thousands throughout the empire and beyond. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>This weakness would also be exploited by contending political
    forces within India as the prospect of a political settlement loomed. As Prime
    Minister Clement Attlee put it at a cabinet meeting on 17 August, “Nothing
    could be worse, if we are about to establish self-government in India, than to
    let the impression grow that rebellion was an easy thing that need not be taken
    too seriously.”<a href="#_ftn144"

style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[144]</span></sup></sup></a> At
    another cabinet meeting 25 October it was suggested that allowing soldiers who
    had violated their oaths of allegiance to go unpunished, would, “readily lend
    itself to action subversive of the Government.” Here however, it was not only
    the British administration that was threatened, for this potential subversion,
    “might have incalculable consequences for independent Indian Governments in the
    future.”<a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145"
title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";

    the trials was therefore portrayed not merely as a policy which served British
    self-interest, but which sought to ensure the stability of any future free
    India.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>A related but more direct security concern went beyond the threat
    to morale within the Indian Army or the showing of a weak hand to rebels in
    general. Colonial officials feared that released and cashiered soldiers who had
    served in the INA would soon reemerge as the trained and experienced core of an
    “Army of Congress” which would rise up against British rule, or else combine
    forces with existing armed rebels. At a meeting of provincial representatives
    held on 14 and 15 August, “[The governor of] Bengal in particular stated that
    their terrorists were eagerly awaiting the return of these determined persons
    trained in the use of arms, and methods of violence.”<a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[146]</span></sup></sup></a> Only the detention and a gradual release of those who were no longer regarded
    as a threat could be countenanced. In an October letter to Pethick-Lawrence,
    Governor-General Wavell passed on troubling rumors that Congress leader Jawaharlal
    Nehru had engaged in “subversive conversations” in Lahore, about his, “plan to
    make use of the INA&#8212;large quantities of arms are said to have been
    smuggled into India from the Burma front&#8212;both to train Congress
    volunteers and as a Congress striking force; and also possibly to tamper with

    justification for trials was later played down, “abstract justice.” It was
    within this discussion, which initially emerged almost as an afterthought, that
    the issue of violence and brutality was raised. Injustice here included both
    the sense of betrayal&#8211;framed primarily as betrayal of fellow Indian
    soldiers rather than the British Empire, and injustice in the form of
    illegitimate violence. Was it not a sheer insult to the bravery of the Indian
    Army who served loyally in battle, the question was posed, if those who cast
    off their allegiance and fought for the enemy were allowed to go free? And what
    of the Indian POW who, despite the prospect of beatings, hard labor, and
    starvation, resisted the call to join the INA and remained true?</span></p>

    the cause of justice for the indignant POW had the virtue of transforming the
    INA trials from a British Imperial cause into an Indian one. As seen above,
    reports of anger and bitterness towards the INA were included in intelligence
    briefings at least by June, 1945 but it appears to have been discussed as
    justification for legal action only somewhat later. In October Wavell predicted

    of the INA. The 1 November issue of <i>Indian Information</i>, produced by the
    Bureau of Public Information included a feature on Badhwar under the title
    “Refused to Join the I.N.A.” Describing Badhwar’s ordeal together with
    Dhargalkar in Bangkok it concluded that “only a man of exceptional courage and
    physique” could have resisted the temptation to give in to the temptation to
    betray the Indian Army and join the INA. After he was returned to the camp, he

    Governor-General Wavell records in his journal that, when he met with the
    acting-editor of the <i>Times of India</i>, Ivor S. Jehu on the eve of the

    was the first disaster. The murders that decorated the treason charges made

    would be acts of duty rather than murder. To make matters worse, the evidence
    for these executions was so confused that Desai and the rest of the defense
    team made a mockery of it, even to the point of denying that the murdered men
    had ever been executed at all. All the murder charges were dismissed and only a
    single charge of abetment to murder in the case of Shah Nawaz Khan was
    sustained. Even in Khan’s case, no separate sentence for the charge was issued

    arguments about international law and rights of belligerency, and on the other,
    an opportunity for the defense to defend the honor of the INA and refute the
    British arguments that it was filled with cowards and press-ganged POWs. With
    the murder charges treated as a derivative of the primary charge of waging war
    against the King, well over three quarters of Desai’s 172 page-long closing
    address to the court was dedicated to reviewing grander themes rather than the
    specifics of the violent acts designed to single out the suspects for trial. In
    the case of defending the honor of the INA, as the Judge Advocate General later
    noted in his review of the legal issues, much of the court’s time was wasted by
    both prosecution and defense in establishing a point of likely complete
    irrelevance: the degree to which the INA consisted of coerced recruits or
    patriotic volunteers. </span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>On the role of international law in determining the validity of
    treason charges, the Congress defense lawyers embraced two approaches. They
    argued that INA volunteers were not bound by their oaths of allegiance to the
    Indian Army because Britain failed to protect them following the surrender in
    Singapore. Indian soldiers were, unlike other Western soldiers, separated and
    “handed over” to the Japanese. As we shall see in Chapter Five, an almost
    identical argument was later used by Philippine lawyer and leading wartime
    collaborator Claro Recto, when he argued that United States sovereignty over
    the Philippines was suspended by virtue of its having abandoned its duties to
    protect its people. </span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>Determining the impact of the INA and the INA trials on the
    Indian Army was a more complicated matter. We have seen already the concerned
    reports of the effects of the INA issue on military morale. Early in 1945
    correspondence of the colonial leadership implied that officers and soldiers
    within the Indian army had demanded harsh punishment. This was gradually
    replaced with anecdotal evidence that the army was more inclined toward
    leniency. On 13 February, 1946 Auchinleck distributed a post-mortem to all army
    commanders on the question of what the impact of the first INA trial had
    actually been on the Indian Army.<a

font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[203]</span></sup></sup></a> In
    preparation, he studied a large number of reports from unit commanders and
    other sources. Auchinleck concluded that the impact on the general public in
    India could be summed up as “pleasure and intense relief” at the commutation of
    sentences on Shah Nawaz, Dhillon and Sahgal in the first trial. When it came to
    Indian officers in the Indian Army, Auchinleck found that the “vast majority”
    were “glad and relieved” that the commutation avoided inevitable chaos. Only “a
    few recovered prisoners of war” reacted differently. When it came to the rank
    and file of the Indian Army, he found that there was in fact very little
    interest in the trials, with the exception of technical units, clerks, and the
    like. Again, those who had suffered at the hands of the former INA in the camps
    might “feel bitterness” at the leniency shown but these were estimated to be
    few in number. </span></p>

    Force or Navy, but was confident that everything he said also applied to them
    since, after all, they were better educated and politically minded.
    Unfortunately, he couldn’t have been more wrong. Within a week of writing the
    report, elements of the Royal Indian Navy mutineed in Bombay, eventually
    involving the personnel of over seventy ships. Whatever the driving causes of
    the mutiny might have been, its participants cited the example of the INA as
    one of their main inspirations. They sang INA songs during the mutiny, and
    included the release of all detained INA members as one of the top political
    demands of the rebellion.<a href="#_ftn204"

    to public criticism which has not been in accordance with the traditional
    loyalty I am entitled to expect.”<a

    always very perceptive or imaginative” and thus not able to grasp the delicate
    political considerations of the trials. Resentful voices such as these, that
    had been enthusiastically embraced to justify larger-scale trials early on were
    now being chided as lacking perception and imagination. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>Auchinleck’s letter to his commanders is revealing in two ways.
    In the first we find him only interested in gauging responses to the
    commutation of sentences&#8211;a decision which very clearly helped avoid a
    deepening of the crisis but which came at the end of a long chain of decisions.
    It would have been far more useful to carry out a similar study of Indian Army
    perspectives, say, during the two months between the August communiqué and the
    November opening of the trials. The question posed then might have been the
    views of Indian Army soldiers on holding any trials in the first place.
    Auchinleck’s letter also contains clues to his own evaluation of the key
    moments in the events leading up to the trials where things might have been
    handled differently. Should the INA members have been dealt with summarily on
    the battlefield, he asked. Should trials have been kept secret? The former he
    judged impractical, especially when a whole INA division surrendered without
    firing a shot. This ignored the fact that there was an active effort to
    minimize summary courts of justice for INA members long before the capture of
    Rangoon in 1945. On the question of secrecy for the trial Auchinleck believed
    that this would deny the accused a fair trial. This ignored the fact that it
    was standard practice in Britain to hold wartime trials for violations of the
    Treachery Act of 1940 in secret and execute those found guilty in similar
    obscurity.<a href="#_ftn206" name="_ftnref206"

    inconveniently dated offenses seems equally unjust.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The most surprising omission in his report, however, was any
    consideration of the relationship in the trials between crimes of illegitimate
    violence and treason. It did not consider the possibility of trials, such as
    those carried out by most Allied armies, that did not include charges of waging
    war against the King. Nor did his report or the debates in the fall of 1945 consider
    the alternative of trying those accused of flogging regular POWs to death,
    shooting indiscriminately at POWs, or of torturing POWs first, as was done in
    the case of the first Japanese war crimes trial in Singapore. If they were
    purely crimes for violence, rather than including charges of treason, it may
    have significantly altered the political calculus as Congress fully backed the
    INA defense. It is easier for us, decades after decolonization, to imagine
    these alternatives. But this is part of the point: in the fall of 1945 the
    balance of concern was so weighted towards a politics of treason that it
    trumped the better judgment of fairly pragmatic late-colonial officials. They
    were blind to the alternative of war crimes trials that were already underway
    for Japanese soldiers, but beyond this less realistic possibility, went out of
    their way to try, in the most symbolic of places, treason together with violent
    crimes that could just as well have handled in the relative obscurity of
    wartime military courts, on a arbitrary scale of the Army’s choosing. The
    “first-class blunder” of the Red Fort trials was certainly one of the most
    important events in the final stages of decolonization on the subcontinent. The
    INA rarely had the opportunity to participate in the brutal counterinsurgency
    campaigns of Japan’s occupations, and thus the crimes of brutality its soldiers
    were accused of were generally limited to POW abuse and the execution of its
    own members. As the following chapter shows, however, the early postwar trials
    would have an impact on the handling of crimes more serious and larger in scale
    than those considered in India.</span></p>

    cases involving atrocities of the Indian National Army had not only backfired
    as a way to dull opposition to what was widely seen as purely political trials,
    but it was further embarrassing because the trials failed to prove that the
    Indian National Army had engaged in anything close to the brutality the
    Japanese military was known for. Though some trials for atrocities without
    charges of treason continued into the spring of 1946, they generally confirmed
    the image of a liberation army that stayed focused upon its military goal and
    avoided the darker consequences of military collaboration which sullied the
    reputation of some of Japan’s other military allies. At worst, nationalists

    Britain stretching from Shanghai to Singapore, from Malaya to British Borneo.
    Engaged in trade or directly serving local British administrations, when
    Japanese occupations were established, Indians were particularly vulnerable
    targets. The Japanese military saw them both as a source of wealth to be
    squeezed, and unlike the Chinese minorities that were often assumed to be
    hostile, Indians were actively courted or coerced into an independence movement
    that was expected to fully support Japan’s war effort. This support was often

    December 1948, 280 deaths sentences (222 confirmed) were handed down in British

    resembling the limited local control offered in Burma following its nominal

    1944 contrasts significantly with the retreat of the INA in Burma. The latter
    had reportedly good relations with a local Burmese population that had good
    reason to feel uneasy about the returning British Army. In France, the Indian
    Legion was not only made up of racially foreign soldiers, but served in a

    of the French summary trials and executions of these Indian soldiers are not
    well understood. Given how rapidly the Indian troops were moving across France,
    mostly at night, and the fact that they were all executed in the same month
    that the atrocities were committed, it seems unlikely that much of an effort
    went into trying to establish whether or not any particular captured Indian was
    in fact guilty of the crimes reported. Doing so would have been a considerable
    challenge given the wide spread of territory under divided control between
    different resistance groups or local administrations. As in the case of the

    by exotic looking Indians might have played an important role in aggravating

    for atrocities in the context of the broader violence of the moment of liberation.
    The Indians were far from the only foreigners to pass through. There were many
    Soviet citizens, including escaped or deserted Georgians, Russians, and Tartar
    units of the Wehrmacht, laborers who served in the Todt military engineering

    emphasizing the orderly courts-martial of Indians for rape and reports of
    General Elster’s compensation to the local population for atrocities might
    suggest that the German officers did their utmost to control unruly and
    undisciplined legionaries, the terrible German atrocities against hostages and
    civilians did more than anything to set the stage for the violent acts of
    retribution by the resistance in the fall of 1944 and the spring of 1945. For,
    example, when the inhabitants in Angoulême and Châteauroux, or elsewhere on the
    roads east of Poitiers faced the violence of the passing Indian legionaries at
    the end of August and in early September, only a few months had passed since
    the wholesale massacre by German soldiers of over six hundred villagers,
    including women and children, in Oradour-sur-glane on 10 June, 1944, located in
    the neighboring department of Haute-Vienne. Koch-Grünberg and Ernst Bannerth
    may have been spared the fate of their fellow Indian deserters in Poitiers, but
    elsewhere German soldiers were summarily shot by the resistance, as were French
    militia forces who engaged them in what amounted to a civil war across the
    French countryside. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;

    scale of retribution differed significantly according to the state of German
    retreat, local sympathies towards the Vichy regime, the power of local
    resistance groups, and strength of the authority of commissioners despatched by
    the new Republican government. There are no reliable statistics for summary
    executions and considerable debate over their scale throughout France, but even
    when considering only the special courts or “Cour de Justice” set up to try
    collaboration following a June, 1944 ordinance, the Poitiers judicial district
    handed down 272 death sentences; the highest number of death sentences in

    distinction. If the attempt to punish the violent crimes of war by the Indian
    National Army or other Indian collaborators became intricately tied to an
    explosive politics of treason in the British Empire, the experience of the
    Indian Legion in France offered no alternative model to follow: the execution
    of several dozen Indians in the towns of central France was carried out in the
    worst possible context for transitional justice, lacking anything resembling a
    fair judicial process.</span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>This chapter has argued that British policies towards the Indian
    National Army in India contributed to the weakening of an already nearly
    crippled retribution process in Southeast Asia. Taken as a whole, however,
    considering the differing contexts and fates of “Indian renegades” beyond the
    subcontinent reminds us that the varying scale and nature of violence during the
    war varied as much as its relationship between the politics of betrayal and
    retribution for violence in the postwar response. In the case of the former,
    one important contrast is between the conduct of armies in the battlefield and
    security forces maintaining occupations or managing prisoner of war camps.
    However, the relationship with the local population was just as important. Both
    the INA and the Indian Legion faced their greatest challenge during long
    retreats, but the latter was a demoralized force in an overwhelmingly hostile
    environment. These different contexts are also important when considering
    post-conflict responses. If the political dimension introduced by the crime of
    treason led to explosive results in India, it further muffled any attempt to
    reckon with violence in Southeast Asia. And as the case of the executions in
    France suggest, summary courts in the field were anything but a just
    alternative.</span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>Burma was also under control of a British
    Military Administration during the period of transition at the close of the war
    but there are a number of features that set it apart from the experience of
    other British domains in Southeast Asia. Unlike any other place the British Empire
    returned to, in Burma colonial officials had to face a full fledged Burma
    National Army (BNA), raised and trained with the help of the Japanese military.
    Instead of a defeated and discredited force, the BNA reversed its loyalties at
    the last minute to fight against the Japanese and join the victory parade in
    Rangoon. Also, Burma had served as an active battleground for most of the war
    and the opposing forces exacerbated existing ethnic tensions as they sought
    local support. The returning British faced a battered colony after the war, but
    one in which local nationalist sentiment had been boosted by the nominal
    independence awarded it under the Japanese in 1943. The important role of the
    BNA and its leaders, both as a threat to reestablishing British rule and as
    potential partners in the creation of a newly independent Burma, made the
    question of retribution for military collaborators particularly vexing.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The case of Burma is also made more complex
    because, though a British colony, was not merely the British military and
    returning colonial officials who determined the fate of its “renegades.” Only
    at Normandy did the Allies launch a counterattack with a greater variety of
    forces than were deployed in the jungles of Burma. As the Japanese Imperial
    Army slowly retreated in the course of the late 1944 and 1945, it faced Allied
    armies composed of more than half dozen different origins and ethnicities.
    Indians fought side by side with British soldiers and officers of the Indian
    Army. Various ethnic groups within Burma fought in guerrilla units under
    British and American command. In the vast northern interior it was American
    soldiers and officers fighting together with tens of thousands of Chinese
    soldiers who pushed the Japanese to the south and southeast. Unsurprisingly, in
    these areas the Americans and Chinese would help determine the fate of many of
    those who aided the Japanese. Agents of the U.S. Counter-intelligence Corps
    (CIC) actively arrested and sometimes even executed local collaborators,
    treating them as both threats to security, and as individuals guilty of
    illegitimate violence. These CIC agents were not concerned with acts of treason
    as such but with ongoing threats to Allied progress in the war, and with past
    acts which in most contexts would simply be called war crimes. </span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>By contrast, for the returning British
    administration, the issue of military collaboration was, above all, a political
    problem. This was especially true after Japanese surrender. As challenges
    mounted in Burma during the course of 1946, the scope of all investigations and
    trials for wartime treason and other crimes committed by colonial subjects
    under Japanese occupation rapidly narrowed. Ultimately, however, when all cases
    of “simple collaboration” had been dropped and prosecutions only retained for
    those involving torture or resulting in death, it was found that they still
    inconveniently included the most important Burmese political figure of the
    early postwar period, Aung San. Facing the risk of losing an important
    stabilizing partner and with him, the best prospect for a peaceful end to
    British rule in Burma, a new approach to punishing wartime crimes in Burma was
    adopted. In July, 1946, just as Rangoon-based war crimes trials against the
    Japanese were picking up their pace, the acting governor for Burma issued a
    decree which not only prevented the trial of Aung San, but effectively brought
    an end to all proceedings against Burmese accused of wartime treason and
    atrocities.</span></p>

    both during Japan’s invasion of Burma at the opening of the campaign in 1942
    and, more spectacularly, when it turned on its master in the final months of
    Japan’s retreat in 1945. Like the Indian National Army, the Burmese forces that
    fought for the Japanese, and then later against them, also left an important
    postwar legacy. When the British attempted to reestablish control in Burma, the
    existence of thousands of Burmese soldiers, including hundreds of well trained
    officers, played an important part of every major political calculation that
    led up to Burmese independence in January, 1948. Its leading officers went on
    to play central roles in almost all the violent shifts in political power that
    followed, well into the 1960s. </span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>In Burma, as in India, the British Empire’s
    frustrations with its treasonous subjects led to debates over how to punish the
    guilty without aggravating the empire’s already precarious position. As in
    India, the question of how and who to target began as one dominated by the
    issue of treason, was gradually reduced to focus on traitors who were guilty of
    war crimes, and then shifted to examining only the war crimes of a single class
    of military collaborators. In both cases the British faced the awkward question
    of punishing traitors in colonies that were seen as rapidly approaching a
    period of self-rule, if not complete independence. In both cases the pragmatic
    and utilitarian instincts among British military and colonial officials
    prevailed over the rule of law or any desire for retribution against traitors

"Minion Pro"'>There are, however, at least two important
    differences between the Indian and Burmese cases. While Subhas Chandra Bose's
    Indian National Army suffered an increasing number of desertions during the
    course of the Japanese retreat, for the most part it continued to fight with
    its Japanese allies through to the final defeat. By contrast, the Burma
    National Army rose up against the Japanese in the spring of 1945 and hastened
    Japan's expulsion from Burma. As Japanese casualties at the hands of the Burma
    National Army mounted, there was an increasing consensus that these forces had,
    in a phrase often used in official British correspondence, “worked their
    passage home,” and thus removed the stain of collaboration.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>&nbsp;A second difference is at least partly
    attributable to the impact of one case upon the other. As it debated the
    question of wartime military collaboration in Burma, British officials never
    let the similar case of the Indian National Army stray far from their mind. In
    both India and Burma the British government attempted to make a clean
    distinction between those who were merely guilty of treason or of waging war
    against the King, an offense for which, as we have seen, the death sentence had
    in some cases already been carried out during the war, and those who were
    additionally guilty of wartime atrocities.<a

    India, however, the British finally moved forward with some prosecutions, if
    only against a few men, in the “Red Fort trials” from late 1945 to early 1946.
    The unified opposition within India engendered by these trials and the violence
    they sparked were noted carefully by government officials who feared any
    escalation of political violence in Burma. The final decisions on the Burmese
    cases were taken at the time these events were unfolding in India and thus had
    a very direct impact for two reasons. Violence like that which broke out in
    India was predicted for Burma as well. Perhaps more importantly, the
    substantially weakened British rule in Burma had been for many decades heavily
    dependent upon the use of Indian troops, whose loyalty was now more than ever

    Burmese collaborators in general, and specifically the Burma National Army,
    even after it switched sides. In November 1943, the chief civil affairs officer
    for Burma, Maj. Gen. Charles F. B. Pearce, noted that, in addition to section
    121 of the Penal Code which provides for a penalty of death or life sentence, a
    similar clause in the Defense of Burma Act provides the same penalty for
    anyone, “with intent to wage war against His Majesty, or to assist any state at
    war with His Majesty…” Pearce pointed out that, in the year 1943 alone, at

    a certain amount of mental anguish on being condemned to death by a tribunal;

    collaboration problem to leave a core of punishable “turncoats who happened to

    the highly political crime of treason. One turncoat, accused of murder, was too
    valuable to lose. The 1946 law created to save him ended attempts to try other
    Burmese collaborators accused of atrocities, even as prosecutions of Japanese
    soldiers for similar crimes proceeded throughout the year. Though his

    representatives of Burmese groups were eager to avoid anything which might
    contribute to instability. It is possible that trying ethnic Burmans, for
    example, for wartime crimes against Karen villages, might have increased
    confidence among Karens in the sincerity of any newly formed regime, but how

    crimes would offer Communists two tempting political options. They could oppose
    the trials as another example of imperialism at work, or perhaps more
    dangerously, embrace them in the hope that non-Communist leaders of the AFPFL
    were at greatest risk of prosecution. Even without the unknown impact of the
    trials, the crippled British administration was already overwhelmed. However,

    of collaboration was a powerful weapon in the hands of the political
    opposition: populist, leftist and communist inspired political movements lost
    no opportunity to describe the halls of government as a den of traitors.
    However, what the Philippines lacked in duration of occupation in comparison to
    Japanese colonial rule in Korea, it more than made up in terms of the scale of
    devastation, massacres, and rape by Japanese forces and its local collaborators
    after it expelled the United States from the archipelago. Indeed, perhaps the
    most important difference between the two was that the Republic of Korea set
    out to try those who <i>collaborated</i> with its former colonial master, while
    the Philippines was trying collaborators who had <i>betrayed</i> its former
    colonial master, since the treasonous acts were, at their moment of commission,
    a violation of allegiance to the “United States <i>and </i>the Philippine
    Commonwealth.” The treason law itself was virtually identical to the American
    one enshrined in its prewar penal code rather than the product, as in the
    Korean case, of highly contested postwar legislation, and its treason trials
    cited American precedents as often as it did those from the Philippines.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>In the Philippine trials, however, we do not
    find a colonial power desperate to make some last demonstration about the costs
    of disloyalty within its military, as in India, or come to terms with an
    awkward new collaborationist ally without completely ignoring its crimes in
    war, as in Burma. Though it proceeded immediately to try Japanese war criminals
    in military tribunals on Philippine soil, the U.S. Forces handed over suspected
    collaborators to the new Philippine republic within days of its independence in
    1946 without trying any of them. Nor did politicians and accused collaborators
    who led the call for amnesty in Manila build their arguments upon a foundation
    of postcolonial angst. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The Philippine discourse of patriotic
    collaboration was thus unlike any other case in Southeast Asia: the elites who
    served during the occupation were not heroes because they fought for freedom
    and independence, but because they quietly subverted tyranny. In this respect,
    political retribution in the Philippines was unique among the Western colonies
    occupied by Japan. Instead, the discourse on treason in the courts and
    legislature of the Philippines would be remarkably familiar to anyone following
    the same issue in China, France, Greece, or in more than a dozen other
    countries. Historical works in the postwar decades addressing collaboration in
    the Philippines almost invariably emphasize the complexities of loyalties under
    colonial rule to explain the logic of collaboration and to be sure, in wartime
    propaganda the legacy of American colonial rule was ceaselessly condemned, but
    in the early aftermath of the war the leading political collaborators rarely
    deployed this defense. Instead they arguing they had served as a shield for the
    people in a time of war. As the three Filipino judges in the very first treason
    case of the newly established People’s Court noted when confronting the shield
    defense in their ruling, “Suffice it to say that Petain, Laval and Quisling,
    and no lesser figures from many lands, have all repeated the catchy selfsame
    plea.”<a href="#_ftn391" name="_ftnref391"

"Minion Pro"'>Political retribution against collaborators
    in the Philippines did share, however, one central feature with the processes
    we have examined in the Indian and Burmese cases: here too the problem of
    collaboration was dealt with by reducing consideration only to military
    collaborators and those responsible for atrocities. In the Philippines the
    outcome of this process yielded more stabilizing results at the political
    level, as a limited 1948 amnesty for the elites who held wartime positions or
    who were leaders of the occupation war economy for the most part averted
    serious political unrest. In the following chapter we will examine the debates
    over the amnesty and find that, while support for leniency was sufficient to
    ensure an overwhelming vote of support for the presidential decree, there was
    also considerable discomfort about its scope. The exclusion from the amnesty of
    thousands of cases of accused military collaborators and those guilty of
    atrocities was contested by legislators who pointed out its contradictions and
    the social injustice it represented. The exceptions were ultimately justified
    by emphasizing the undeniable horrors of the violence committed by the
    perpetrators but, as the trials themselves would show, treason prosecutions
    were a deeply flawed vehicle for confronting the atrocities of war.</span></p>

    soldiers. This is not to be underestimated. As Pacita Pestaño-Jacinto, whose

    Terami-Wada, has also identified a number of other independent auxiliaries
    which were recruited locally and attached to Japanese units either for labor
    purposes but which sometimes participated in military action. Around the same
    time as the founding of the Makapili, a “New Leaders Association” was formed
    which had an armed division headed by Aurelio Alvero. Alvero’s treason trial
    was one of the few cases of a higher level figure receiving a conviction, which
    the Supreme Court affirmed in 1950. Artemio Ricarte, a leading nationalist
    veteran of the Philippine-American war, organized his own “Volunteer Army of
    Peace and Order of the Philippines.”<a

    mobilization activity in late 1944 was as confusing to the average Filipino as it
    is to historians now, and many came to see all of them, including the Makapili,

    in common, it was that they were on the down and out. Benigno Ramos and Artemio
    Ricarte in the Philippines, Subhas Chandra Bose and Rash Behari Bose from
    India, Ba Maw and Aung San in Burma, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta in the Dutch
    East Indies, Ibrahim Yaacob in British Malaya, former emperor Puyi and Wang
    Jingwei in China had failed to achieve their goals, whether in the political
    arena or through revolution. Whatever their optimism, they faced the
    possibility of a future on the margins. Ricarte, Aung San, and Rash Behari Bose
    fled or were sent into exile, ending up in Japan where they found support from
    radical pan-Asianist organizations. Before Japan restored his empire in
    Manchurian miniature in 1932, Pu Yi spent more than half a decade under its
    protection in the Tianjin Japanese concession. Ba Maw and Ramos were
    languishing in prison until they were released by the Japanese and both Sukarno
    and Hatta were freed from their remote domestic exile following the conquest of
    the Dutch colony. After being expelled from his position as editor of the Malay
    nationalist newspaper <i>Majlis</i>,<i> </i>Yaacob sought out support and
    funding from both British and Japanese sources in exchange for becoming an
    espionage agent, and was arrested by the British at the outbreak of war. Subhas
    Chandra Bose and Wang Jingwei were both charismatic, widely respected, and
    powerful contenders to become the leading political figure in their respective
    nations, but the rise of each was eventually thwarted by his political nemesis.<a href="#_ftn447" name="_ftnref447" title=""><sup> <sup><span

    of the Makapili has become inextricably tied to the image of the treasonous
    informants who accompanied the Japanese on their counterinsurgency raids
    throughout the occupation period. Both in oral histories collected long after
    the war, in the testimonies of victims and witnesses in the early postwar
    trials, and in films and other postwar media, the term Makapili has broadened
    to be used interchangeably with traitor, spy, and informant. It is referred to
    in places where the Makapili was never active, and in periods of the occupation
    long before the organization was founded. The evil which the name invokes,
    however, cannot be fully appreciated without considering the association of the
    Makapili with one particular kind of hooded informant known as the “Magic Eye.”
    In the Philippines, the Magic Eye technique was sometimes employed when
    assembling the entire population of a village or an urban district in a
    practice the Filipinos referred to as “zoning” (<i>zona</i> or <i>sona</i>)
    during which each man and, in some accounts, woman was lined up in front of, or
    had to file past an “Eye” who nodded or pointed fingers at guerrilla suspects,
    thereby condemning them to a death at the hands of a Japanese sword or bayonet
    or at least arrest, interrogation and torture. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The Magic Eyes were the darkest shadow of
    collaboration in the Philippines. In the municipal and national offices
    reluctant bureaucrats, politicians and elites are mostly described as busily
    ignoring or diluting Japanese directives that came their way, all the while
    sending intelligence to the guerrilla groups in their area. Meanwhile, in the
    villages and rural areas, where immediate proximity to violence was
    unavoidable, the consequences of collaboration were most apparent in the
    example of these anonymous characters. In film, these frightful figures can be
    found in the early postwar Hollywood film shot in the archipelago “An American
    Guerrilla in the Philippines” (1950) and more recently in the 2001 Philippine
    submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, “In the Bosom
    of the Enemy” (“Gatas… Sa dibdib ng kaaway”), the 2004 film “Aishite Imasu
    Mahal Kita” (I love you), and, though replacing the <i>bayong</i><b> </b>bag

    occupation of the Philippines, long before the founding of the Makapili in
    December, 1944, and well beyond the central Luzon plains where they were most

    evidence of adherence to the enemy&#8212;the two required components of any
    treason conviction in the Philippines as it is in the United States. This was a
    marked contrast with laws for the punishment of collaboration with Japan in,
    for example, Nationalist or Communist controlled territories of China or in
    South Korea, for example, where high office holders were explicitly targeted,
    even if mitigating clauses offered judges great flexibility.<a href="#_ftn475" name="_ftnref475" title=""><sup> <sup><span

    bar for adherence to the enemy was set so high that it required the prosecution
    to virtually step into the hearts of the accused and prove they were completely
    empty of patriotic feeling. Words spoken in praise of the Japanese Empire or
    calling for guerrillas to lay down their arms were but the moving of a helpless
    puppet's lips; war materials sold to the enemy were just the everyday business
    of an honest merchant. As long as a collaborator spoke other words in private
    against the occupier or contributed some percentage of their profits to the
    resistance, the possibility of “feigned cooperation”&#8212;the favorite term of
    the accused and judges alike, could not be ruled out. In his account of the
    progress of the People's Court up to the amnesty, David Joel Steinberg traces
    the “growing sympathy” of the courts for claims of “justifying circumstances,”
    until finally procedural issues came to dominate each case in the final lead-up

    while the People's Court had been trying cases for more than two years it had
    not reached a final judgment on any “treasonable collaboration with the enemy.”
    Assuming that final judgment was taken to mean that the appeal of convictions
    had been ruled upon by the Supreme Court, this was simply untrue. Over two

    Court, an institution which represented the surgeon who operated upon the
    “gangrenous” wounds of the nation, together with the amnesty proclamation and
    resolutions of concurrence supported widely across party and factional lines,
    the collaboration issue immediately became less visible and depoliticized. Unlike
    Burma and India, in the Philippines, there was a two step process. First
    treason cases involving atrocities and military collaboration were segregated from
    prominent political cases. They were then merged together with regular criminal
    cases in criminal courts not designed to handle the complexities of a wartime
    occupation or the special considerations of evidence and so on that helped justify
    special treason tribunals. The crime itself remained treason. Inevitably, given
    the large number of cases that remained, this prolonged the process
    significantly even as it removed the issue from political consideration. In the
    next chapter we will examine some of the many cases that remained in the courts
    and how the laws of treason continued to serve as a poor weapon against the

    aborted. In the Philippines the trials continued outside of the public eye in
    regular criminal courts but remained trials for treason. Through a subset of

    wartime atrocities committed in the service of the enemy would remain in the
    courts for years after the 1948 amnesty. The People's Court Papers, which
    contain the case files from most of the treason trials after the war, are today
    housed in the University of the Philippines Main Library in Diliman and any
    close study of the People's Court from September, 1945 to June, 1948 will need

    1948 is extremely close in number to the count of 157 Supreme Court rulings I
    have identified, but it is less than half of the 323 wartime collaborators who
    received a pardon in 1953. A closer examination of cases in the lower courts
    after 1948 would be necessary to compare post-amnesty conviction rates with the
    People’s Courts. The prediction, in the amnesty debate, by Manuel T. Cases that
    a second more complete amnesty would follow the one in 1948 within a few weeks
    was not completely incorrect, if very premature. As we shall see, almost all of
    the treason convictions considered here were covered in a mass pardon issued by
    President Quirino in 1953 and only four of the cases come from the years

    relationships with other leading wartime political collaborators, it would be
    unfair to suggest that these men used their office to provide direct judicial
    backing for Japanese or Constabulary repression of the resistance. Instead, the
    wartime Supreme Court justices kept themselves busy with relatively trivial
    matters while the war raged around them. In the <i>Official Gazette</i> of the
    wartime Republic from October, 1943 to June, 1944 there are only 27 Supreme
    Court decisions listed. Of these, all but one of the cases were economic in
    nature, involving inheritance, land transactions, the repayment of loans, and
    the illegal use of trademarks. To give but one example, in February 1944, the Supreme
    Court ruled on whether or not the Secretary of Labour could compel the operator
    of a rice mill to repair an engine which vibrated so severely that it shook the
    foundations of the building. The only case which came close to the violence of
    war was a May 1944 decision affirming the conviction in a conspiracy to murder

    collaboration and atrocities committed by traitors, a new rebellion by the most
    powerful wartime guerrillas, the Hukbalahap, was brewing on the plains of

    Japanese occupation, or in special military courts, together created an

    treason cases, the Supreme Court corrected judges of the People’s Court or
    courts of first instance which combined allegations of treason with murder or other
    violent crimes. Lower courts frequently ruled that military collaborators,
    informers, and spies were guilty of treason on the one hand and separately of
    violent crimes on the other. When combined as “complex crimes” as defined by
    Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, conviction guaranteed
    that the maximum penalty for the heavier crime would be given, which helps
    account for a large number of death sentences handed down. Thus, a military
    collaborator who joined a Japanese patrol and, say, beat or tortured an
    individual or robbed suspected guerrillas or, if convicted of the “complex

    very nature partakes of a deed or physical activity as opposed to a mental

    often is, in itself a criminal offense under another penal statute or
    provision. Even so, when the deed is charged as an element of treason it
    becomes identified with the latter crime and can not be the subject of a separate

    enemy occupation, assuming that adherence to the enemy could be demonstrated,
    the murder of a guerrilla is not murder but treason. It is not a traitor who
    commits the killing but a murder that makes the traitor. Besides the fact that
    a complex crime would have guaranteed the harshest punishment, this ruling
    could be beneficial to the accused in other ways. Whereas a murder case
    required only a single credible witness to convict, murder which constituted
    treason required two. It also ensured that the, “factual complexity of the

    kinds of murder: killing for personal motives, killing for the cause of
    freedom, and treasonous murder. This may seem to be an obvious and natural

    investigated for arson. The fact they served their sentence in a provincial
    jail rather than a military garrison, argued the court, suggested they were not
    suspected guerrillas but common criminals. In the case of the order to capture

    adherence to the enemy was the biggest challenge for any prosecutor. As in the

    cited for this was the 1947 case <i>People v. Manayao</i>. Unlike other accused
    members of the organization who claimed to be the most dedicated of super
    patriots fighting against imperialism, Pedro Manayao claimed in this case that,
    as a Makapili, he had joined the Japanese Imperial Army, sworn allegiance to
    Japan, and was therefore no longer a Filipino citizen. The court dismissed this
    argument in the simplest of terms, “We are of the considered opinion that the <i>Makapili</i>,
    although organized to render military aid to the Japanese Army in the
    Philippines during the late war, was not a part of said army. It was an
    organization of Filipino traitors, pure and simple.”<a href="#_ftn544" name="_ftnref544" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;

"Minion Pro"'>These were the extremely violent days of
    late 1944 and early 1945, after Japanese reinforcements flooded in, guerrilla
    attacks ramped up, and American forces returned to the archipelago. Manayao’s
    institutional affiliation or even his citizenship seems hardly the issue worth
    quibbling over given the nature of the violence that followed. The timing is
    key. Constabulary forces predominantly joined Japanese patrols and raids from
    mid-1942 to mid-1944 and while there were regional upsurges in violence where
    Japanese military carried out large scale mopping up campaigns, such as in
    Leyte around October, 1943, the Constabulary was on the other side of the
    violence of the early 1942 invasion and had mostly abandoned its posts when the
    violence peaked again in late 1944. The Makapili certainly “adhered to the
    enemy,” but even if some of its members genuinely desired&#8212;as surely many
    Constabulary officers who joined Japanese raids did&#8212;to minimize civilian
    deaths, they came into being at a moment when the cycle of violence in Luzon,
    where they were most active, had reached its most horrible stage of mass
    reprisals. In some cases, however, such as that of Pedro Manayao, witnesses
    testified that the cruelty of these military collaborators far outstripped that
    of the Japanese soldiers they accompanied. In late January, 1945, as American
    troops were about to begin retaking Manila, guerrillas launched an attack on
    occupation forces in Angat, in the province of Bulacan. In reprisal for the
    attack, Japanese soldiers, together with Manayao and other Makapilis, took revenge
    upon the nearby barrio of Banaban. The men, women, and children of the village
    were gathered together and, with the exception of the children, all sixty or
    seventy of them were slaughtered. Two young survivors who were spared testified
    that the Japanese soldiers stopped the Makapili Manayao, who was a local known
    by his nickname ‘Pedro, the Painter,’ from killing the children as well, at
    which he allegedly protested that, “the children would be wives of guerrillas

    dismissed this charge in both cases for lack of two witnesses to any overt act
    confirming official membership. Instead, it used this evidence in the charge to
    confirm the adherence to the enemy required to convert other acts of violence
    into treason. The court came to the same conclusion in other cases, such as those

    worked in the Manila Electric Company as a lighting inspector. In October, 1944
    he accepted a job as a foreman and interpreter for the Japanese manager of a
    Japanese company identified as “Mataichi Kabushi Kaisha” but known by its
    prewar incarnation as the government founded Nacoco (National Coconut Corporation).<a href="#_ftn554" name="_ftnref554" title=""><sup> <sup><span

    testified that he drilled and commanded “<i>Makapili</i> soldiers of the <i>Nacoco</i> Military Police” numbering between 300 and 400 Filipinos, which were
    headquartered at in the Nacoco garrison. In his own testimony denying all the
    accusations of atrocities, Osi said he had “drilled the laborers” of the
    company and that they all eventually retreated with the Japanese. Prosecution
    witnesses accused Osi of leading Makapili, sometimes in the company of Japanese
    but other times making no mention of them, in the confiscation of food
    supplies, the arrest of numerous suspected guerrillas who never returned to
    their homes, the mass burning of homes, and of participating in the massacre of
    50 bound captives in a foxhole near the garrison. While the term Makapili is
    used throughout the details of the ruling, the question of official membership
    and the actual existence of any formal Makapili unit was not considered in the
    Supreme Court ruling. If the accused was at least telling the truth when he claimed
    to have drilled laborers of the company, instead of the image of a band of 300
    to 400 rabidly pro-Japanese Makapili recruits bent on destruction, this may be
    an example of one of the many small-scale and less formal local efforts by the
    Japanese to train and arm Filipinos who were already employed by an institution
    run by the occupiers. Of course, this would not alter the facts of extreme
    violence and atrocities carried out by those involved, but serve as another
    reminder that the patterns of this violence are closely tied to the contexts of
    particular times and places, rather than neatly assigned to particular
    institutions and their ideology. </span></p>

    counterinsurgency scenario: soldiers and their informants hunting down a series
    of known or suspected guerrillas, whose names may have been obtained through
    the interrogation and torture of already captured individuals. The informers
    might be a recently tortured prisoner, an intimidated local community member, a
    hostile neighbor willing to help the Japanese settle a score, or more regular
    informants who knew the local area well. While these raids on individual homes
    could be terrifying and involve extreme violence both at the scene of capture
    and once the targets had been taken back to the garrison, the zoning of an

    cases of these atrocities when Filipino collaborators were the perpetrators or
    indirectly complicit? Let us consider two cases. In March 1949, the court gave
    a ruling on an appeal in the treason case of one Cucufate Adlawan.<a href="#_ftn570" name="_ftnref570" title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";
"Minion Pro";'>[570]</span></sup></sup></a> Adlawan had been sentenced
    to death by a lower court for the “complex crime of treason with murder,
    robbery, and rape,” in an indictment that included 23 counts. As a member the
    Bureau of Constabulary from March of 1943 to May, 1945 and later in the service
    of the Japanese military police, he was accused in count after count with
    participating in mop-up operations against guerrillas with Japanese forces,
    arresting suspected resistance members, engaging in beatings and torture that
    sometimes resulted in the death of the victims, as well as the direct
    bayonetting of civilians. Adlawan was also accused of stripping the wife of a
    suspected guerrilla and raping several young girls during a raid in the company
    of Japanese military police in August, 1944 in Cordoba, Cebu. Staying
    consistent with other rulings in which the Supreme Court argued that lower
    courts should not have convicted suspect of “complex crimes,” it was ruled that
    Adlawan should be convicted of treason alone without commenting explicitly on
    whether rape constituted one of the <i>acts</i> of treason that were thereby
    merged into the crime. However, there is reason to believe that it did not
    consider rape as one of the individual treasonous acts. Citing the precedent of <i>People vs. Racaza,</i> the unanimous ruling argued that the stripping of the
    wife and the rape of the Filipino girls could be considered, “two aggravating
    circumstances of unnecessary cruelty and ignominy.”<a href="#_ftn571" name="_ftnref571" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;

    interrogation, and guided Japanese soldiers on raids, constituted the very acts
    of his betrayal of the nation. However, his attempt to rape a woman who refused
    to offer information during a raid were explicitly reduced to aggravating
    circumstances which were seen as, “deliberately augmenting unnecessary wrongs,”
    without themselves constituting overt acts of treason. In a separate opinion on
    the same case, Associate Justice Gregorio Perfecto (served 1945-1949) concurred
    with the conviction but argued that the attempted rape should not even be

    and the uniquely political crime that was treason. Sexual violence in war
    against a suspected guerrilla was not, he argued, like beatings, torture, or
    the killing of civilians, a <i>political</i> crime that provided aid and
    comfort to the enemy and therefore should play no part in a treason conviction.</span></p>

    themselves constitute acts of treasonous violence then neither would the
    abduction of women into sexual slavery. Again, let us look at two cases. We
    have already met Jose de Castro, whose membership in the Bureau of Constabulary
    did not, according to the Supreme Court, itself constitute treason. Castro’s
    original <i>reclusion perpetua</i> sentence was not only based on his BoC
    status, however, but on the fact he joined with Japanese soldiers on a
    nighttime raid on suspected guerrillas in January, 1945 in the El Pardo suburb of
    Cebu. Two women who lived in the targeted house were suspected of having a
    connection to guerrillas and, after being strung up by their arms for
    interrogation, they were both imprisoned for several weeks. After her release,
    one of the girls was again taken from her house by Castro to the home of the
    Japanese sergeant, one Yoshida, who led the raid, where he, “made some amorous
    advances” and, “threatened to kill her and all the members of her family should
    she not consent to live with him.”<a

    became the sergeant's “mistress.” The court ruled that Castro had done “nothing

    be an aid to satisfy the lust of a Japanese officer,” but this brand of aid to

    inconsistency in the court's argument. Susano “Kid” Perez was convicted of
    treason by the same People's Court that had convicted Castro and was sentenced
    to death. In all six counts of treason Perez was accused of “commandeering”
    women to serve as sexual slaves for Japanese officers and sometimes raping the
    women himself. In some cases deception was employed, as when Perez asked for
    women to testify against some accused suspect, or when he attempted to convince
    a reluctant woman who had already escaped once that a Japanese colonel merely
    wanted her to be his secretary. According to testimony in the trial, the same
    colonel would go on to rape or enslave more than half a dozen women provided
    him by Perez. In one of the counts, Perez took a woman he had delivered to the
    Japanese colonel directly from a rape encounter to an uninhabited house where
    he then raped the traumatized woman himself. On other occasions, Perez abducted
    women from their homes and delivered them to banquets and dances where those
    who were “selected” were subsequently raped by Japanese officers in attendance.

    disagreed. The reasoning is worth quoting at some length:</span></p>

    general rule, to be treasonous the extent of the aid and comfort given to the
    enemies must be to render assistance to them as enemies and not merely as
    individuals and in addition, be directly in furtherance of the enemies' hostile
    designs…His “commandeering” of women to satisfy the lust of Japanese officers
    or men or to enliven the entertainment held in their honor was not treason even
    though the women and the entertainment helped to make life more pleasant for
    the enemies and boost their spirit; he was not guilty any more than the women
    themselves would have been if they voluntarily and willingly had surrendered
    their bodies or organized the entertainment. Sexual and social relations with
    the Japanese did not directly and materially tend to improve their war efforts
    or to weaken the power of the United State[s]. The acts herein charged were
    not, by fair implication, calculated to strengthen the Japanese Empire or its
    army or to cripple the defense and resistance of the other side. Whatever

    also, of course, protect those women who had been accused of treason for their
    relationships with the Japanese, whether they were intimate or not; whether
    they were willing or involved varying degrees of coercion. However, Perez, who
    freely admitted accusations that he had violently coerced women, deceived them,
    and knowingly participated in the procurement of sexual slaves for Japanese officers,
    would not receive any punishment for those acts, which were dismissed as “trivial,
    imperceptible and unintentional” in their effect. The judges never fully
    confronted the fact that Perez was not simply procuring reluctant dance
    partners for the Japanese but knowingly facilitating their rape by the officers
    that they were either directly submitted to or who were in attendance at the
    banquets at which, as testified to in count after count, women were raped. The

    around the issue of the rape of the women who testified and speak only in more
    vague terms of “entertainment.” Instead, the violation of Philippine women was
    seen by Pablo as very much a “crime political in nature.” However by conceding

    victims of the violence in order to argue that the crimes of rape and sexual
    slavery were an affront to the nation itself. He asked rhetorically whether

    were overturned by the Supreme Court that we would not, in any case, expect to
    be in prison, one death sentence that may have carried out, and five persons
    whose sentences were shorter than <i>reclusion perpetua</i> that may have paroled
    early. This leaves only nine other individuals not on the pardon list for
    unknown reasons. They may have died in prison, been released early, or not have
    qualified for the amnesty, but they do not represent, for example, cases tied
    to the worst massacres. Among those that did make it onto the pardon list was
    one of the two whose death sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court, Roman
    Vilo, and also Susano Perez, whose treason conviction was overturned but
    replaced with several counts of rape. The total number of 323 pardons includes
    some 201 names not found in the 157 Supreme Court rulings which exceed the
    number of People’s Court convictions reached by the time of the 1948 amnesty.
    If these others were also convicted of treason, or crimes that replaced them such
    as in the case of Susano Perez, it is a strong indication that the courts of
    first instance proceeded with convictions in the years that followed on an even
    larger scale than that of the People’s Court.<a

    resulting from the choices made. When the 1948 amnesty argued that “public
    sentiment did not extend” to those who waged war on the Philippines and carried
    out atrocities against the people, it set aside some acts of violence as
    fundamentally different in nature. It did this in a fashion not entirely
    dissimilar from the way war crimes trials around the world after World War II,
    including the Philippines, similarly struggled to create and foster a own realm
    of universally prohibited violence. However, the trials for treasonous
    atrocities and war crimes trials differed in two fundamental ways: in the cases
    of Burma, India and the Philippines that we have seen here, the retributive
    process created this space, or attempted to create this space, at the
    conclusion of a process of elimination rather than an active attempt to
    confront the horrors of the war. Secondly, in each case the violence at the
    heart of the charges were, as we have seen, ever-clouded by the primary crime
    they were judged for: a violation of an allegiance to the nation. When William
    Pomeroy noted that the traitors who walked out of prison on that July day in
    1953 were more despised than thieves and murderers, one might have noted that
    almost all of those released by President Quirino’s pardons were convicted of
    the <i>treason</i> <i>of murder</i>; each held responsible for the deaths of
    their countrymen at their own or Japanese hands as a result of their
    collaboration.</span></p>

    archipelago: the prosecution of General Yamashita Tomoyuki by a U.S. military
    court for the atrocities of his men. The Yamashita case of late 1945, which
    resulting in his conviction and execution, established a principle of strict
    liability in command responsibility for war crimes that would not be approached
    again in law until the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva
    Conventions or in actual cases until the later stages of the war crimes trials

    for treason convictions in the Philippines virtually guaranteed that any
    distance between the violence and the accused would result in a dismissal. In
    Burma, Aung San himself carried out one of the executions that fell within the
    realm of prohibited violence that the British had come to adopt in their effort
    to severely curtail their treason trials in the colony, thus posing for them a
    unique challenge. In the Philippines, however, the “small fry” collaborators
    who were so patronizingly referred to as the “ignorant simpleminded credulous
    Filipino,” by congressman Lorenzo Sumulong in the 1948 amnesty debates, carried
    out their daily interactions with the Japanese occupier within earshot of the
    screams of the tortured, and as witnesses or themselves participants in the
    executions. When they evaded responsibility by claiming to be, “just following
    orders” to cooperate with the Japanese military or to join in the urgent task
    of eradicating the “bandits” throughout the land these excuses were, in the
    majority of cases, dismissed by the Supreme Court, as they were in the trials
    of war criminals. However, the responsibility for the atrocities that came with
    military collaboration rarely extended beyond the immediate scene of the crime.</span></p>

    committees, and Pio Duran who was nominally vice-supremo of the Makapili.
    However, it was just as true for actual military commanders, as we saw in the
    acquittal of the surviving former head of the wartime Bureau of Constabulary,
    Guillermo Francisco. Even more remarkable, was the inability to account for any
    kind of command responsibility in the trial of the head of the wartime Manila

    national scope of the Constabulary was such that he was completely ignorant of
    the fact that many of his units, even those who maintained strong connections
    to some resistance forces, were actively engaged in the suppression of Huks and
    other guerrillas, regularly engaged in torture, and that some units carried out
    summary executions. It is far harder to imagine that Torres could have been
    wartime Manila police chief without being aware of the deep collaboration
    between his officers and the Japanese military police, or the torture and

    The mayor of Manila turned down his request in 1948, but he pressed his case

    “American Guerrilla in the Philippines” (1950) a scene is dedicated to the
    confrontation between a village and a fleeing informer. While the village
    looked on quietly, the informer was offered a piece of chicken as his last
    meal. Before he was shot, he was simply told, “You are a fifth columnist and a
    bad man and we are going to kill you.” In “Lost Battalion” (1962) the main
    antagonists are not the Japanese, but a cruel band of rival guerrillas led by
    the smooth talking villain Bruno. In “Back Door to Hell” (1964), two American
    officers try to save Japanese prisoners of war from torture at the hand of
    Filipino guerrillas but during interrogation the officer, played by a young
    Jack Nicholson, apparently failed to sufficiently impress them with his
    Japanese language abilities. The guerrillas took over, extracted the required
    information by torture and executed the prisoners. These scenes were structured
    not to condemn the Filipino guerrillas for their cruelty. They were designed to
    highlight the naivety of the newly arrived Americans, and presumably the
    audience, who did not understand the realities of war. In “Manila, Open City”
    (1968), the audience learns that when it came to the Makapili, “the guerrillas
    have been butchering them ever since they moved into town” and one of the
    leading Filipino characters in the film, when exposed as a “Makapili informer”
    is shot and left to die by the road. The director offers him a brief hint of
    sympathy as the audience watches him die, giving him the lines, “You want to
    know why? I don’t know why. I just wanted to get along.” The line was a well
    chosen shibboleth used by those accused of wartime collaboration around the
    world. Rarely, however, did a film show greater compassion for the fate of an
    executed collaborator than the 1976 “Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos” (Three Godless
    Years), a film written and directed by Mario O’Hara produced during the Marcos

    brutal crimes of war happened far from the battlefront but, more importantly,
    were carried out by a thoroughly mixed dramatis personæ that included both

    other forms of retribution in the period of transition was the most tragic but

    domestic perpetrators to find redress through a judicial process, whatever its

    carrying out limited retribution against military and police collaborators were
    gradually replaced by efforts to punish only those responsible for atrocities.
    In most cases, these proceedings were still carried out under laws against
    treason and sedition. Military and police collaboration with the Japanese
    empire presented postwar regimes with their most challenging class of traitors.
    Together with informers, these figures were more likely than anyone to
    participate directly or indirectly in the most violent acts of the occupation.
    Whether they were Indian police officers torturing prisoners on behalf of the
    Japanese military, Burmese forces taking over villages long under the control
    of other ethnic groups, or Philippine Bureau of Constabulary units who
    selectively crushed rivals in a divided resistance, these forces could not be
    counted upon to, as some postwar apologists might like to believe, insulate a
    vulnerable populace from the repression of a foreign occupier. Not only did
    some military and police collaborators show a greater propensity for brutality
    than the Japanese units they accompanied&#8212;sometimes motivated by personal
    hatreds or a fear of what awaited them at the hands of their enemies after
    Japanese defeat, but the instability created by a contested military occupation
    often allowed parties of both new and old social, political, and ethnic
    conflicts to find violent resolution under the protection and legitimacy
    provided either by Japanese occupation authorities or those who proclaimed the

    occupation police, militias, auxiliaries, “puppet” soldiers, and colonial
    levies represented a cross-section of occupied societies distinctive only for
    the heavy representation of the most disadvantaged classes. The Makapili of the
    Philippines, recruits for the Burma Independence Army, the hundreds of
    thousands of soldiers who fought with Japanese forces in China, and the Korean
    colonial police forces may have all have had leaders from the ranks of the
    elite, but were mostly made up of farmers, refugees, or the urban poor. To
    dismiss every member of a relatively small and short-lived armed group such as
    the Makapili as deviants and thugs was one thing&#8212;something made all the
    more easy by associating them with the terrifying magic eye informers, but it
    was more difficult for postwar regimes, especially in the Philippines, Korea,
    and China, to account for the years of involvement by large numbers of ordinary
    citizens in occupation institutions of repression. The Philippine Bureau of Constabulary
    was not just a good cover for resistance work, it was a well paid position in a
    time of wartime hardship. A young Korean with a limited education who entered
    the police had better prospects for advancement than in most alternate careers
    in a colony filled with discriminatory barriers. A Chinese village militia that
    was once supported by a long-since-fled landlord may have found cooperation
    with the local Japanese garrison a far less daunting option than going in

    Second World War, alongside the informer, the interpreter, the enemy’s
    mistress, the spineless merchant, and the puppet leader. However, what
    distinguished most of the military and police collaborators from the rest of
    these hated characters was the anonymity of their numbers. Unlike the toady
    interpreter or treacherous informer, usually portrayed as a hunched and
    effeminate figure standing behind a Japanese soldier, or the image of the
    bejeweled mistress walking proudly with her officer and patron, the mass of
    hundreds or thousands of militia and police were mostly faceless figures, often
    depicted, accurately in many cases, as dirty and disheveled in contrast with
    the crisp uniform of the occupier. Whatever violent acts they partook in, it
    was easier to see these men not as lacking patriotism but merely misguided

    the threat those numbers constituted to the survival of any postwar regime. In
    most transitional regimes, whether they are emerging from a foreign occupation,
    a civil war, or a revolution, a new government must evaluate at least the four
    most challenging costs of dismantling or and punitive action against domestic
    enemy forces: 1) the lost opportunity or challenges of employing these forces
    for their own purposes, 2) the active force required to carry out disarmament
    or retribution, 3) the potential disorder and discord caused should retributive
    violence get out of control, and 4) the possible threat of these forces
    embracing a political rival rather than risk punishment. The strength of calls
    to punish treason and avenge specific atrocities committed by these forces are
    factors which can limit the range of viable choices or at the very least
    seriously affect the outcome, thus acting as a potential moral and cultural
    obstacle to what might otherwise be a raw political or military calculation.</span></p>

    sworn enemies but also had an unquenched thirst for independence. Their
    professed cause was in no way discredited by Japan’s surrender. On the
    contrary, it was, as we have seen in Burma, emboldened. Demobilizing these
    forces was a significant challenge; large scale retribution, all but
    impossible. Before the end of the decade, all three colonies had gained

    United States was only slightly delayed by the Japanese occupation, the
    returning Americans and the new government of the new 1946 republic faced its
    most serious armed competitors not among the ranks of the collaborators, but
    from the resistance, especially the ideologically committed Hukbalahap. The
    Philippines was offered a nominal sovereignty by Japan at the same time Burma
    was in 1943, and the Japanese empire deployed much of the same rhetoric against
    Western imperialism. However, the Bureau of Constabulary, though like the INA
    composed in great part by POWs and offered “rejuvenation” under Japanese
    tutelage, never much resembled either the INA or the BIA and its successors in
    Burma. The Philippine BoC neither unified behind charismatic nationalist
    commanders nor was it an army that cultivated a strong dedication to the cause
    of an elusive independence. Its prewar composition, as well as its wartime and
    postwar incarnations all became closely tied to local collaborating elites or,
    covertly, with factions within the local resistance that reflected longer
    trends in the power dynamics of the community, rather than with a broader
    national movement. Alternative forces which may have borne greater resemblance
    to Burmese and Indian counterparts, including the Makapili, were given little
    opportunity to develop, and were plunged into the work of violent repression
    the moment they came into existence.</span></p>

    have placed tens of thousands of constabulary officers on trial for their
    wartime actions were largely prevented, as we have seen, by the establishment
    of generous “loyalty boards” which allowed constabulary officers to quickly
    resume their service after Japanese surrender, and the 1949 Supreme Court
    ruling <i>People vs. Jose de Castro</i> which made explicit the fact that,
    unlike membership in the Makapili, service in the Bureau of Constabulary was
    not, by itself, treasonous. The trials that followed focused upon the
    atrocities of the occupation, but continued to prosecute these crimes as
    treason, with the complications and biases that we saw at work in the previous
    chapter.</span></p>

    treason prosecutions against wartime military and police collaborators, and
    their relationship to the trying of atrocities has focused for the most part on
    one particular legal approach to what posed both a political and military challenge
    to postwar regimes. With the exception of police dismissals in Malaya, little
    has been said of the complex administrative steps taken to exclude wartime
    collaborators, whether they were military, police, or held other positions.
    While not as sensational as treason prosecutions, this broader and rarely
    well-documented process was also important. In India, the British attempted,
    with only limited success, to prevent INA soldiers from becoming part of the
    police or Indian or Pakistan army after 1947.<a

    Burma, one of the most tense and involved conflicts leading up to independence
    in 1948 was in determining how many former BNA officers could be absorbed into
    the British army, and whether to permit many of those among them were not
    accepted to constitute a uniformed militia force under Aung San’s leadership.
    In the Philippines, not enough is known about the workings of the loyalty
    boards or about other leadership changes in the Constabulary to explore the
    ways in which administrative methods were used to reform, or merely transform
    this institution in the immediate aftermath of the war.</span></p>

    contexts not the primary&#8212;means to handle thousands of treasonous military
    and police. Another choice was the mass incorporation of these forces into the
    institutions of the postwar order. If punitive measures or the demobilization
    and dismissal of collaborators involved heavy costs, the simple mass absorption
    of the same into the postwar state could be far more than simply a logistic
    challenge: it could threaten the legitimacy of the regime. The absorption of
    thousands of Burmese National Army (later Patriotic Burmese Forces PBF) forces
    into the British army and the continued service of Philippine Bureau of
    Constabulary forces that had passed loyalty boards are two Southeast Asian
    examples of this process of incorporation. In Burma, as we saw, this would come
    at the cost of increased tensions with those ethnic groups that were most
    effected by wartime repression. In the Philippines, opposition forces and the
    Huk rebels made ample use of the Constabulary’s wartime conduct in its attack
    on the regime. In neither case, however, was there any significant effort by
    the postwar military establishment to force its new members to confront the
    conduct of military collaborators during the war. </span></p>

    creative approach to military collaborators taken by Communist forces in
    Shandong province. Embracing the early approach taken by the British towards
    INA “patients” or the Japanese to its Philippine prisoners of war, the
    Communist Party in Shandong treated military collaborators with Japan as men
    malleable enough to be cured of their affliction. While the wartime years usually
    figure as a prelude in most of the discussion of previous chapters, this
    chapter must reverse that order to spend the bulk of its time on the war years
    from 1937 until Japanese defeat. Whereas earlier chapters portray the gradual
    formation of a stable policy, in this chapter we will see a relatively stable
    approach briefly disintegrate in the chaos of Japanese surrender, only to
    reestablish itself in the civil war that followed.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>But what was this affliction? National betrayal or a propensity
    for violent repression? Chinese Communist efforts to win over military
    collaborators up to Japanese surrender in Shandong used threats of punishment
    for both and yet depended upon a willingness to completely overlook any sin in
    exchange for a timely surrender. This feat was accomplished by separating the
    Party’s handling of military collaborators from its punishment of other
    traitors through mass trials. For military collaborators to overcome their
    illegitimate or “puppet” nature, a change of loyalty was all that was required.
    In the early postwar, the re-education efforts launched by the Party continued
    for those few Japanese-allied “puppet” soldiers who had the misfortunate of
    finding themselves to be prisoners of war in the summer and fall of 1945 but
    these military collaborators were no longer segregated from an increasingly
    unruly mass “Oppose Treason” mass campaign of the early postwar. </span></p>

    vital role played by military collaborators in preserving Japanese control over
    occupied areas, especially after 1942. They also understood how valuable these
    armed groups could be as sources of information, supplies, and in the end, of

    Japan, even if accusations of national betrayal and brutality played a leading
    role in wartime propaganda against them. While expedience in dealing with
    military collaborators was fairly universal in World War II, as in other wars,
    this was facilitated in this particular case by a wartime institutional
    division of labor that served to isolate most military collaborators from the
    more unpredictable outcomes of a “traitor elimination” process which was given
    an ever increasing “mass character” (</span><span style='font-size:11.5pt;

    military and police collaborators who failed to change sides in time and found
    themselves in the custody of Communist allied forces in Shandong in the weeks
    before and after surrender were turned over to cadres of the Public Security
    Bureau and its traitor elimination work. If, up to this point, defection might
    allow them to escape punishment as traitors or face close scrutiny for wartime

    collective, expressions of remorse. They were to benefit from an official
    policy of magnanimity and only a small minority of them subjected to a process
    of mass trials for collaborators that were taking place at the same time.
    Sometimes, as we shall see, calls for vengeance by the communities who suffered
    at their hands during the occupation made a policy of leniency a challenge for
    the party. Those who survived the process, or by defection avoided the first

    to survive. The term falls somewhat short, however, in accounting for their
    changeable loyalties. They did not blindly serve any master but actively sought
    to retain or expand their power within the limiting parameters of a tactical
    alliance with the Imperial Japanese Army. When this proved stifling or
    dangerous, they were often content to switch sides whenever the opportunity
    presented itself. As Liu Hsi-ming has argued in a detailed study of the puppet

    national army under the Wang Jingwei regime. In northern China, the multiple
    layers of political and military power that emerged out of years of Japanese
    encroachment made for an especially complex environment. Japanese military
    influence stretched back to the Manchurian incident of 1931, and well beyond
    that to the years of Japanese presence along the South Manchurian Railroad. In
    addition to its sponsorship of a new Manchurian nation in the northeast, in the
    early 1930s the Japanese military cultivated a number of local autonomous
    political bodies to fragment Nationalist control including the Hebei-Chahar
    Political Council and the East Hebei Autonomous Council. The Japanese military

    large numbers of its own forces for mopping-up campaigns. Also, it was equally
    important to quickly garrison areas that were newly deemed to have been purged
    of resistance forces. The new puppet armies played a key role in achieving both

    pillage, and killing. Liu’s men were deeply loyal to him, however, and he

    measures alone could probably bring this number up to about 5%. This percentage
    could be doubled, he argued optimistically, to 10%, or around 90,000, by using
    “financial” measures. In what can only be described as a proposed investment
    plan, Zhu outlined the accounting for his estimates. The requested $20 million

    to puppet officers ranging from squad commanders and up through platoon,
    company, battalion, regiment, and even the proposed bribery of ten puppet
    division commanders. Some 3,000 squad commanders were to be offered $30 each,
    while division commanders were to be offered $10,000. In addition to these
    one-time defection bonuses, this fund was to include post-defection awards to
    officers who were brought over by political measures and “comfort fees.” Third,
    almost a million dollars was to be set aside for bounties to puppets for
    bringing over various weapons ranging in value from rifles ($20 each) to
    artillery ($1,000), as well as valuable communications equipment. Radio sets,
    for example, were to be purchased at $200 a piece. Fourth, almost five million
    dollars was put aside to pay puppets their original salaries for three months,
    for a supply of clothing and equipment, a fund for gifts, and subsidies for the
    families of the defected puppets. Finally, a reserve fund of five million was
    to be put towards using military collaborators for sabotage and demolition

    General Robert McClure and the Communists that culminated in an offer to send
    thousands of American airborne troops to be stationed in Communist controlled
    territory. The final result of the complicated process was a warning by General
    Hurley to President Roosevelt that the offer of close military cooperation with
    the Communists was a dangerous development that threatened the preservation of
    the Nationalist regime. On 27 January, Chief of Staff George Marshall ordered
    that no negotiations were to continue that did not also involve Chiang

    one additional large unit had come over to the Communist with the defection of
    1,800 soldiers under Han Shouchen in June, 1945. Despite this very late change
    of loyalty, Han remained in command of his forces. After the capture of
    Hangzhou in 1949, the former puppet army commander became the head the city’s

    division and local resistance forces grew more confident and moved to the
    offensive. Though they are even more likely to be susceptible to wild
    exaggeration, the cumulative reports of claimed puppet army kills in a
    selection of wartime chronologies of Shandong regional gazetteers are vastly
    higher, especially from local skirmishes listed for the summer of 1945 when

    later turn to the Communists when the nationalist cause in Shandong was truly
    deemed lost by mid-1948. For the most part, however, when Nationalist forces
    returned to the province in 1945, beginning with the entry into the province of
    its new governor He Siyuan, they resumed control of only the small number of
    towns and strongholds that were still under Japanese and puppet army control.

    soon have the option of continuing to serve in the Nationalist army. If this
    was a conspiracy, however, it was one in which the Communists participated. If
    most puppet armies served the Nationalists after the war, it was not because
    Communists refused to absorb the forces of the occupation. During the crucial

    key innovation of the Communist Party in dealing with military collaboration
    with Japan was that, up until Japanese surrender, its general policy was to
    isolate them from its mass campaigns and treat puppet soldiers as <i>neither</i> traitors nor as war criminal suspects, even if it portrayed them as such. In
    propaganda, in Party sponsored publications, and in postwar literature their
    violence and national betrayal was a regular topic of discussion. Threats made
    to puppet soldiers who the CCP tried to win over, and the red and black point
    system also, of course, primarily focused on the seriousness of the crimes they
    were guilty of. However, the Enemy and Puppet Work Bureau judged its success by
    the metric of loyalties won, not by criminals punished. Every puppet soldier
    executed for crimes committed against civilians or resistance forces could
    potentially frighten away an entire unit of his fellow soldiers. Until a new
    regime under the leadership of the Communist Party was strong and stable, those
    lost rifles and the lost fighting ability would not only denied the Party but
    serve the Japanese or the Nationalist central government that sought its
    destruction. We already saw this threat become a reality in Laiwu when the
    Party alienated the followers of the Middle Way society and even more following
    its attack on the leadership of the Hard Fist Society.</span></p>

    Shouchen surrendered and given command of a newly reorganized Fourth
    Independent Brigade in the army of resistance. These forces had picked the
    right side at a moment when a new stage in the Chinese civil war was about to
    begin and they could potentially avoid punishment for wartime crimes
    completely&#8212;or at least until future political campaigns in the 1950s and

    safely in Jinan, Qingdao, or a handful of strongholds in the otherwise
    Communist landscape of Shandong stood a reasonable chance&#8212;but as we shall
    see by no means a guarantee&#8212;of continued employment under a Nationalist
    regime desperate to reestablish its hold on the province. They could then defect
    to the Communist enemy work bureau when the opportunity presented itself and

    Han people, the term most directly referred to the betrayal of the Party and

    of Trotskyists in the Huxi Incident of 1939, along with several similar
    incidents, the Shandong Sub-bureau began to slowly deemphasize the threat of
    Trotskyists in its internal directives to traitor elimination cadres, call for

    using their work as another way to mobilize or awaken the masses. While enemy

    to combine meticulous stage management of trials with an effort to carry out of
    the will of the people and thereby win their support. Activists were planted,
    suspects chosen, evidence carefully prepared, but disappointment expressed at
    the outcome in some internal reports suggest that the outcome of trials was at
    lease sometimes genuinely left up to the people, with calls for execution
    subject to confirmation from the district leadership. It was essential to
    create the impression that the people were sovereign, while the Party merely carried
    out its wishes. When it was reported that the people did not feel their will

    an end, but they lacked discipline and often ignored directives, especially

    directly to the government. If the people’s militia catch you, they will stone
    you to within an inch of your life,” one was reported saying. Another pointed
    out the risks of magnanimity being combined with mass rallies where their
    victims could call for their death, “The government is magnanimous, but if the
    people in the village aren’t magnanimous, it does you no good.” And again,

    I argued that trials for wartime atrocities under the laws and courts of
    treason were not limited to the countries and former colonies this work has
    focused upon. They were common to most of the states affected by the Second
    World War. Some of the treasonous war criminals brought to trial were executed
    or served prison sentences. Others were caught up in the waves of retributive
    violence outside the courtroom. For those who faced trial, why did it matter
    what was written on their indictments? Why should victims have cared if their
    torturers were tried in a tribunal for treason or one for war crimes? As long
    as the perpetrator’s deeds were denounced and their violence punished, what
    difference did it make? It is unlikely that the woman we met in Chapter Seven,
    who confronted her father’s killer on the stage and proceeded to beat him to
    death with a stone, was at all interested in the fact that the accused had been
    put before the villagers as part of a political campaign against traitors, rather
    than as a murderer. The young Filipino girl who survived a massacre of hundreds
    to testify in court against the accused Makapili member Florentino Canibas may
    not even have known the accused stood on trial for the “complex crime” of
    treason with murder. </span></p>

    may not have made a difference to these particular victims in the early
    aftermath of war but each of the chapters of this dissertation has argued that
    punishing brutality as betrayal had significant consequences on both the
    specific outcomes of the proceedings, and upon the broader political
    environment in which they took place. Nowhere was the prospect of treason
    trials, of any kind, as flawed an approach as in the late colonial contexts of
    India and Burma. In India, the attempt to punish the “turncoats who happened to
    be brutes” not only produced a violent backlash, but further weakened
    proceedings across Southeast Asia where there were more appropriate targets for
    prosecution. In Burma, the highly politicized process of trying military
    collaborators was abandoned entirely. While Japanese war criminals were being
    tried for the massacre of Britain’s loyal minority guerrillas, colonial
    officials blocked any attempt to try Burmese soldiers who had participated in
    similar acts. In the Philippines, I have argued that the very creation of the
    category of military collaborators that was excluded from the amnesty of 1948
    was a deeply problematic. Moreover, some of the characteristics of the treason
    law itself had a profound impact on the selection of the accused and the
    evidence required to secure conviction. </span></p>

    treason did not merely have an impact on the legal process of retribution. It
    further facilitated an alternative approach that emphasized the reformability

    numbers of military collaborators were portrayed as mainly guilty of crimes of
    the heart or victims of an unfortunate affliction. This made it all the easier
    to justify large-scale efforts to transform them into soldiers that could be
    redeployed once more in the service of the nation. Philippine constabulary
    members could return to the field to fight against their old wartime Huk
    enemies, Chinese puppet soldiers could redeem themselves in the eyes of the
    revolution, and Indian National Army soldiers could “take another crack” at the

    transitional justice and the discourse around it over the past few decades Ruti
    G. Teitel divides its development into three phases, the first of which
    culminated in the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials.<a
href="#_ftn796" name="_ftnref796" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[796]</span></sup></sup></a> Most other works also point to this as a foundational moment for transitional
    justice. The trials helped inspire the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
    the Genocide convention, and influence the 1949 Geneva Convention, but
    diplomats failed in their early postwar efforts to create an International
    Criminal Court. The lack of a cooperative spirit in the international community
    as Cold War loyalties hardened was certainly a key to this failure, but just as
    important was the realization of how great the sacrifice of national
    sovereignty would be entailed by any permanent court.<a href="#_ftn797" name="_ftnref797" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;

"Minion Pro"'>A second phase in the development of
    transitional justice is tied to the wave of transitions beginning in the 1970s
    and accelerating into the post-cold war. Transitions in Spain, Portugal and
    Greece were followed soon by a wave of regime changes in Latin America. For
    Teitel, the most important feature of this period is the way in which tensions
    between demands for punishment and amnesty helped generate new ways of
    confronting the past beyond the criminal trials of early postwar period. This
    created new debates that balanced issues of punishment with attempts to uncover
    truth and pursue reconciliation, as well as find a balance between maintaining
    peace and achieving justice.<a href="#_ftn798"
name="_ftnref798" title=""><sup> <sup><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[798]</span></sup></sup></a> In
    Teitel’s final phase, the justice of transition moves from the periphery to the
    center. It has entered a period in which the normalization of transitional
    justice and the expansion in the laws of war have given rise to new risks as calls
    for humanitarian intervention and defense against terror are subject to ever
    greater politicization.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>If Teitel is more focused on the development
    of law and specific practices as a result of these changes, Sikking’s “justice
    cascade” is centered upon the “Shift in the legitimacy of the norm of
    individual criminal accountability for human rights violations and an increase
    in criminal prosecutions on behalf of that norm.”<a href="#_ftn799" name="_ftnref799" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Minion Pro";
'>[799]</span></sup></sup></a> Instead of distinct and somewhat disconnected phases, Sikking sees this cascade
    formed by the merger of a “streambed” of international humanitarian law, a
    growing number of state prosecutions both international and national in scope,
    and finally an increasingly important role for non-state actors, including
    Amnesty International and domestic human rights organizations around the world.
    Again, the early postwar trials were a foundational moment, but for Sikking as
    well as a number of other scholars, their greatest contribution was that they
    led to an, “</span><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:

    because it focused on the individual&#8212;both as the perpetrator of crimes
    and as a victim who had standing to bring forward cases against perpetrators.”<a href="#_ftn800" name="_ftnref800" title=""><sup> <sup><span

  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;
"Minion Pro"'>The fact that individual criminal
    responsibility of perpetrators for atrocities was established in the
    international tribunals after the Second World War is duly noted by every
    scholar of the trials, but as Sikking notes, the individualization of the
    victim is also important. This is not at all clear in many of the charges
    issued in the international tribunals, which played such a heavy emphasis on
    the crimes of aggression that involved Germany and Japan’s invasion of its
    neighbors. In these cases, the victims were the occupied countries as a whole
    and, compared to later war crimes trials for conflicts in Yugoslavia and Rwanda,
    the ties to individual atrocities were somewhat more tenuous. It was in the
    national-level war crimes trials and in the American military tribunals that
    the individualization of the victim was most prominent. In these trials
    Japanese military police were tied directly to their torture victims and
    Japanese generals tried, for example, for command responsibility in the cases
    of massacres in Manila or the horrors of the Bataan death march. In historical
    terms, this second shift is even more important when we move beyond an effort
    to trace transitional justice as a process with clearly defined origins
    somewhere in the twentieth century, or else as emerging boldly from a long and
    tainted history of political trials. The extent to which this was also achieved
    in postwar treason trials for atrocities is more mixed. In the treason trials
    we have looked at, in the Philippines, for example, this individualization did
    happen to a certain extent. Victims of specific acts of violence could face the
    perpetrators of torture and massacre in trials. Under the rules for complex
    crimes, however, they shared their status of victim with the nation. When
    Constabulary, or Puppet Armies were returned to service after proving their
    loyalty or joining the revolution, their wartime atrocities could be completely
    whitewashed since it was understood that their primary crime, if any, was a
    nation, or Party, willing to forgive its children.</span></p>

    efforts to weaken competitors? I don’t think that is fair, but there is no need
    to argue that point here. Political trials up until the mid-twentieth century,
    especially those in transition, typically did not individualize the victim.
    When they bothered to defined one, the crime was against an injured party, to
    be sure, but that injured party was often a community, a realm, a way of
    living, a political party, or a nation. The major exception to this was in the
    age before the nation-state when, as in old English treason laws for example,
    the accusation was of, “compassing the king’s death” or “levying war against
    him.”<a href="#_ftn803" name="_ftnref803"

    was the sovereign and only corporeal representation of any real individuals
    harmed. Also, while treating the sovereign as the violated party was
    widespread, it was not true of all treason laws before the rise of the modern
    nation-state. In the Roman Republic and the empire that followed, the
    treasonous crime of <i>maiestas</i> was short for <i>maiestas minuta populi
    Romani</i> or “diminishing the majesty of the Roman people,” and the ancient
    Athenian crimes of betrayal and subversion were for the betrayal and subversion
    of Athenian democracy.<a href="#_ftn805"

    always lead protagonist of any conspiracy. To it was often attached any number
    of heinous deeds, as in the case of the indictment of Charles I above. For the
    most part, however, they were secondary crimes, supporting actors in a plot of
    betrayal. At the trial of King Louis XVI in late 1792, several dozen complex
    charges were brought against him, but many of them focused on accusations he
    had conspired with the enemies of France. It was these charges, claimed Camille
    Benoít Desmoulins in his passionate speech advocating for a sentence of execution,
    that were most, “odious to the people,” since, “Treason was always with every

    far as I have been able to determine, Desmoulins was right. The crimes of
    betrayal, however they were named, were usually among the most despised of all
    crimes. Of the “ten abominations” that constituted the most despicable crimes
    in the Ming dynasty code, for example, half are crimes of betrayal and
    disobedience on some scale: plotting rebellion, plotting great sedition,
    plotting treason, contumacy, and lack of filial piety.<a href="#_ftn807" name="_ftnref807" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;

    crimes trials of the early aftermath of the war were a powerful foundational
    moment in the rise of transitional justice and the ‘justice cascade’ effect,
    they were preceded by a long tail of important developments in law and human
    rights. These included the nineteenth century campaigns against slavery, the
    Hague conventions, the response to the horrors of the First World War, and the
    minority rights movement in the League of Nations. We are now witnessing a
    reverse of this trend in the case of treason. The great collaboration trials
    after the war&#8211;where they reached any significant scale&#8211;represented
    a last global surge in retribution against those who had betrayed the nation;
    those who violated what the moral philosopher Michael Sandel might call the

"Minion Pro"'>Of course, treason did not disappear from
    the face of the earth at the close of the 1940s, but the postwar period can be
    described as its long declining tail. It remains strongest outside of the
    courtrooms, where a passionate hatred for those who are seen to have betrayed
    the loyalties demanded by community may well be a constant of human society.
    Almost every conflict of the postwar involved cries of traitor as well as
    summary executions and disappearances carried out in the name of punishing
    treason. The two greatest genocides of the postwar period, in Cambodia and in
    Rwanda fed upon it. In Cambodia, the victims were accused traitors to the
    communist <i>Angkar, </i>or the ‘organization.’ Their confessions, obtained
    under torture, described acts of petty sabotage against the revolution that
    were punished with execution in the killing fields. In Rwanda, the wholesale
    massacre of Tutsis and their Hutu “collaborators” is a famous example of ethnic
    violence, but it was partly justified by their alleged treasonous support of
    rebels and other conspiracies of betrayal. In the revolutionary wars of Libya
    and Syria too, rebels have aggressively hunted down and massacred suspected
    informers and government sympathizers, while all the authoritarian governments
    affected by the Arab Spring have more than matched them in their own efforts to
    liquidate traitors. </span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>In courts around the world, however, a
    change is easy to recognize, even in legal systems that fall far short of
    international calls for fairness. Together with the shift in the legitimacy of
    the norm that represents the ‘justice cascade,’ we are witnessing the gradual
    decline of treason as the preferred means of judicial retribution.
    Increasingly, the victim is no longer defined as the nation as a whole. With
    each small step towards the recognition of individuals as victims, with each of
    their personal suffering highlighted, and as each assailant is drawn into the
    various practices that constitute transitional justice, treason dies a little. In
    the Greek trials of the military junta and its police forces in 1974, the
    leaders of the military junta were all tried for high treason in the first
    trial, but the subsequent trials were for torture and murder alone. In the wave
    of transitions in Latin America, those that held trials would increasingly
    charge their former leaders and their police and military organs with human
    rights crimes while those including charges of treason decreased in number.
    However troubled they were as legal proceedings, the trial of Saddam Hussein in
    Iraq was for crimes against humanity, of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia (in
    absentia) was for complicity in the murder of 43 protesters, and against Hosni
    Mubarak in Egypt for complicity with murder of protesters and corruption. None
    of these trials included charges of treason. </span></p>

"Minion Pro"'>As always, there are exceptions. In South
    Korea, former presidents were tried for treason but were quickly amnestied in
    1997. A much-noted Special Act in 2004 was passed to investigate the treasonous
    conduct of colonial period collaborators and an act was passed in 2005 to
    confiscate the property of some colonial collaborators. Even in a Korea, where
    a long suppression of the collaboration issue has contributed to widespread
    interest in recent years, these acts were far outnumbered by other acts of
    legislation that have helped the country confront the atrocities of Korea’s recent
    history, including the removal of statutes of limitation on human rights
    crimes, acts to investigate suspicious deaths and establish a process of truth

    Left to carry out retribution without outside interference, some states would doubtlessly
    continue to carry out trials for treason in unwitting imitation of their
    predecessors. In February, 2012, one of the first trials in Libya after its
    recent revolution charged 50 people of the crime of “treason against the
    revolution,” but this was the same crime that was used by Qaddafi's government
    to punish the opponents that now came to power. The trial was delayed, however,

    a theory of justice must acknowledge the strength of “plural grounding,” the
    idea that we may disagree on what may be the “dominant reason for the diagnosis
    of injustice” in any given case, but that we should be able to identify a
    “plurality of impartial reasons” in our condemnations.<a href="#_ftn811" name="_ftnref811" title=""><sup> <sup><span style='font-size:11.5pt;

    there are alternatives to be had in the form of tangible harms committed
    against specific people. Nor do they sit well with Sen’s call for
    non-parochialism as a required component of justice. I hold that it is
    extremely difficult to, “view our sentiments from a certain distance from us”
    on the one hand, and navigate the complex layers of shifting loyalty that
    emerge in wars and revolution on the other.<a

    certainly a move in the direction of non-parochialism, it is true that this
    transformation has also given rise to a host of debates and critiques of its
    own. The way forward may not be clear, but at least one thing is. If the
    continued rise of transitional justice and international humanitarian law
    threatens the sovereignty of the nation-state, then the decline of treason

    Sartre’s famous essay “What is a Collaborator.” This essay is famous, as Treat
    points out, for its depiction of collaboration as a “strange mixture of
    masochism and homosexuality,” which supports a “sexual union in which France
    plays the female role…” However, the full essay shows the same confused
    depictions of collaboration as a universal phenomenon and one tied to betrayal
    in the context of a foreign occupation and illicit ties to the Other. It is,
    for Sartre, a “normal phenomenon” which lies “latent” in peace, but is
    elsewhere described more generally as anyone who is afflicted by, “that
    intellectual illness that may be called historicism.” This historicism yields a
    twisted realism which, “leads them to submit themselves to rigorously
    individual realities: a man, a party or a foreign nation.” See Jean-Paul Sartre

    which he also argued that the term was plagued by its close orientation with
    the nation-state. Hilary Conroy “Thoughts on Collaboration” Peace and Change
    1.1 (1972), 43.&nbsp; Brook goes beyond a
    critique of the term to argue for a more cautious approach to moral judgments
    about the past in general, offering instead a historian’s imperative to produce
    “moral understanding” that is based upon an appreciation for the contingent
    outcomes of the actions of historical agents. I share with Treat a strong
    commitment to the moral agency of the historian and am far less troubled than
    Brook by the consequences of retroactive judgement in our craft. Brook wants to
    distinguish the work of the moralizing ‘polemicist’ from that of the historian
    but his own important study of local collaboration in occupation China goes
    farther than most in carefully spelling out the consequences of collaboration in
    the midst of mass atrocities. Nor does Brook shy away from drawing some of the
    obvious conclusions, as he does when he evaluates the work of the
    Self-Government Committee (</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    Nanjing. When the body asserted control over refugees in January, 1938 it aided
    a process in which males of fighting age were extracted and handed over for
    execution which, as Brook points out, amounted to, “complicity in war crimes.”

    perpetrators of the Armenian massacres following the signing of the Treaty of
    Sevres in 1920 also floundered. In both cases there were weak national level
    trials: in the German case at Leipzig, and the earlier Constantinople

    mentions that several German officers who were charged with condoning war
    crimes in a postwar trial Bordeaux were acquitted and that the evidence was
    based on “uncorroborated reports of atrocities by the Indian troops…which were
    circulated by the French resistance.” Hartog may be referring to above cited
    reports by local officials. He expresses frustration at being unable to
    convince a student studying the conduct of the Legion in France that these
    charges were false.&nbsp; Ibid., 147. The

    that might be noted with regards to the specific nature of the treason in
    question is that, while the INA was composed in large part of deserters, which
    thus stood in strong contrast to loyal Indians who continue to fight for the
    British throughout the war, there were few Burmese veterans of British forces
    within the BNA, not surprising given the fact the British rarely recruited
    among ethnic Burmans. See Annexure III in “Cabinet: India and Burma Committee.

    crime” or “crimes against humanity,” and hope that through redefining rape as a
    war crime, rather than a ‘natural,’ ‘inevitable,’ ‘boys-will-be-boys’ inherent
    aspect of war, there will be some deterrent effect. But if it is off-limits to
    address the intersections of gender and ethnicity, and the gender regime that
    makes a physical, sexual attack on a woman a blow against the ‘honour’ of a man
    and his community, how likely is it that rape will stop being used as a
    weapon?” Carol Cohn “Mainstreaming Gender in UN Security Policy: A Path to

style='font-size:10.0pt;"Minion Pro"'>Quirino quoted in
    “Sequels: Forgiving Neighbor” <i>Time</i> (July 27, 1953)&nbsp; http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,936085,00.html Accessed
    June 15, 2010. Also, around the same time, Quirino told a Japanese diplomat the
    pardon was entirely driven by a Christian spirit. Nagai Hitoshi suggests
    another related influence on a religious Quirino may have been the interest the
    Vatican took in the issue of showing mercy to the Japanese war criminals. Nagai <i>Firipin to Tainichi Senpan Saiban</i>, 282. The announcement on the evening
    of June 27th by the presidential office however, connected the “gesture” of the
    pardons to the improvement of relations and the reparations issue directly. A
    more direct <i>quid pro quo</i> has also been suggested. While no direct
    evidence has emerged, Nagai writes there is some&nbsp; possibility that accusations published
    elsewhere that a direct payment made to the Quirino regime behind the scenes
    for the pardons may have merit, and statements made immediately after the
    announcement of the pardons continued to suggest Quirino was hoping the pardons
    would have an impact on reparations negotiations. See discussion by Nagai, <i>Firipin
    to Tainichi Senpan Saiban</i>,&nbsp; 282-292, and Chamberlain, “Justice and Reconciliation”, 180-190. Ricardo
    T. Jose suggests that growing U.S. pressure on the Philippines to give up their
    attempt to secure reparations may have been a factor. Ricardo T. Jose “The
    Philippine War Crimes Trials, 1947-1949” in National Historical Institute,<i> Remembering World War II in the Philippines: Proceedings of the Conference

    [Regime] Traitors], 2 vols. (Nanjing: Fenghuan chubanshe, 2004), 155. Zhou
    Gao’s own story shows once again the complex world of betrayal all this took
    place in. He was a confidant of Dai Li, the head of <i>juntong </i>until his
    death in 1945 and was head of the <i>juntong</i> station in Nanjing at the time
    of the trial. However, by the time he testified at Zhou Fohai’s trial where he
    also testified to Zhou Fohai’s cooperation with <i>juntong</i> and embarrassed
    the Nationalist party, Zhou had allegedly already secretly joined the Communist
    party and would soon be under arrest himself. Whether his claims about Zhou
    Fohai, Wu Huawen and other puppet commander relations with <i>juntong</i> were
    true is thus complicated by his potential other loyalties at the time.&nbsp; See Guo Biqiang </span><span
