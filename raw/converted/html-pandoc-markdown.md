**Wartime Atrocities and the Politics of Treason**

**in the Ruins of the Japanese Empire, 1937-1953**

**Abstract**

                  This dissertation explores the relationship between
violence and betrayal in retribution against military and police
collaborators who helped maintain Japan’s wartime occupations up until
its defeat in 1945. Looking at the approaches taken in the colonies of
British Asia, postwar treason trials in the Philippines, and Chinese
Communist approaches in wartime and postwar Shandong province, this
study argues that the laws and rhetoric of treason were deeply flawed
tools for confronting the atrocities of war. At the very moment that war
crimes trials were defining a set of acts that constituted crimes
against all humanity, around the world thousands of individuals who
helped perpetrate them were treated as primarily guilty of crimes
against the nation. Each of the chapters in this work examines the costs
and consequences of this for postwar societies on the eve of
decolonization and civil war.

                   Throughout the territories under Japanese occupation,
locally recruited military and police forces comprised the largest
category of individuals to face accusations of treason in the aftermath
of war, but were also those most likely to be complicit in atrocities.
Among the ranks of the disloyal, they were both the most useful as well
as the most dangerous to postwar regimes and almost always separated out
from other accused collaborators. Their treason was often treated as a
disease of the heart which, once cured, allowed them to be deployed once
more. Attempts to try them for their betrayal often faced destabilizing
political opposition, especially in cases where their wartime actions
were carried out in the name of independence from colonial rule, and
were almost always reduced in scale to focus on those accused both of
treason and atrocities. Marred by the politics of betrayal, the
resulting hybrid proceedings failed to achieve a reckoning with wartime
massacres and torture.

**Acknowledgments**

                  Footnotes and bibliographies rarely reveal the most
important intellectual debts and inspirations of a student. This moment
of transition is a good time to reflect upon them and express my
gratitude. My deep thanks to my parents, who never failed to encourage
me in my studies, and supported me through years of study in far off
lands. Thanks to my uncle Thomas Nilsen who, from a small white house in
Norway, opened a window for me onto Asia. For first introducing me to
his craft, I must thank the remarkable historian Gunnar Skadberg who, in
his own white house on the fjord just down the hill, shared with me his
many adventures into the past. Without the encouragement of my Chinese
and Japanese language professors Kathleen Tomlonovic and Robert Campbell
at Western Washington University, I would likely never have considered
graduate school. I can trace the final decision to pursue a PhD in
history to a single moment in 2001 while doing an almost practical
masters degree in International Affairs at Columbia University. With her
usual passion, Carol Gluck was explaining the role of historians in
society, adding that they must be driven by, “big questions, deep
empiricism, and fire in the belly.” I thank her for that, and for
occasionally reminding me that the nation-state is not dead yet. At
Columbia I must also thank Jai Kasturi, a truly remarkable intellectual
who opened up many a world of ideas to me, as well as Sutaitai (C. P.
Sobelman) for encouraging me to explore new ways of employing technology
in teaching and learning.

I began my graduate study of history with a strong interest in the
history of Sino-Japanese interactions. My thanks to both Josh Fogel and
Hirano Kenichiro, my advisor during my time at Waseda University as a
Ministry of Education research student, for encouraging me in these
studies. Hirano-sensei taught me many things, but more than his broad
and deep knowledge I was constantly impressed at his leadership, his
humility, and as a teacher, his remarkable ability to gently guide his
seminar students to the seeming self-discovery of shortcomings in our
arguments. Having found them, he would then always offer a few ways
forward. In Japan, where I spent most of my time studying China and
Taiwan, much of my free time was in the company of the inspiring Korean
students around me. My interest in Korea grew much as a result,
especially thanks to the friendship of my fellow student of
Sino-Japanese relations Lim Jaehwan and Japan historian Kim Youngsoo.

                  Moving to Harvard for the PhD, I could not have asked
for a better advisor than Andrew Gordon. He never wavered in his support
and has perfectly mastered that rare balance between allowing graduate
students to explore and grow on the one hand, and guiding us gently
towards completion on the other. Generous with his time, fair in his
critique, and always constructive in his advice, it has been a true
honor to be counted among his students. I am also deeply grateful to
Henrietta Harrison, Charles Maier, and Carter Eckert for their guidance.
I think Henrietta Harrison was probably right when she made a passing
suggestion long ago: this project would have been a lot less
overwhelming if I had just found myself a nice Chinese village or two to
focus my study of the politics of retribution. Maybe next time.

                  My research in China, Taiwan, and Korea was generously
supported by an SSRC International Dissertation Research Fellowship, a
Fulbright IIE grant, and summer grants of the Reischauer Institute of
Japanese Studies and the Asia Center. The librarians and staff at the
Harvard-Yenching Library were extremely helpful and I look forward to
seeing them on many future visits. My materials from Korea and Taiwan
will feature in a manuscript based on this dissertation and other
projects in incubation, but here I want to thank those who helped me do
the research that will make it possible. In Taipei, I owe much to the
friendship and support of Lin Yung-chung, Daphné Liu, Samantha Wu, David
Toman, Shadow Chen, Huang Yao Hsien, Jimmy Haver, Hardina Ohlendorf, Lin
Chia-ying, and Vanessa Yang. In Seoul, I must thank Baek Young-seo and
the Institute For Korean Studies at Yonsei University for hosting my
research year there. Thanks also to Lee Sunkyoung for always being able
to tell me exactly where and how to get pretty much anything done, and
to the four language partners who also became dear friends, Hong
Sookyeong, Lee Changnam, Park Sunyoung, and Yi Sangwook. Xu Chang at the
School of History and Culture at Shandong University made my research in
Jinan possible, and his student Cao Yuanqiang was incredibly helpful in
helping me find materials. Arne Brasseur and his band of merry
adventurers kept me sane. Thanks to the archivists and staff of the
Shandong Provincial Archive who put up with my endless requests for
documents.

                  My friends and fellow students made almost every
moment of this process a pleasure. Almost every memory of my first few
years in the PhD program features my fellow musketeers Craig Colbeck and
Nick Kapur. They were wonderful companions. Fabian Drixler has also been
a truly wonderful mentor and friend. I learnt so much from our long
conversations. Brendan Karch helped me develop as a teacher, writer, and
a semi-civilized social animal. Thanks to Denise Ho for all the treason
tidbits, and to Josh Hill, Pär Cassel, Matsutani Motokazu, and Danny
Orbach for everything you taught me. Also, everyone should have a Jeremy
Yellen around: thank you for your energy, your stories, and I look
forward to our future collaborations. Winnie Wong and Rossen Djagalov
became wonderful comrades and I especially appreciated their
encouragement during my push through to the finish. The same to Rachel
Leow and Javier Cha, my two biggest inspirations in the digital
humanities. Sayaka Chatani is in many ways my closest fellow traveller,
chasing the questions of history across many countries and languages. I
look forward to many years of sharing discoveries. Heather, thank you so
much for your patience. This dissertation is dedicated to my sister
Carleen, in admiration of her devotion to family and community.

**Introduction**

The end of the Second World War was also a momentous beginning in
efforts to punish the crimes of war. A combination of new laws, a brief
but powerful confluence of international interests, and most
importantly, a geographically dispersed scale of violence unprecedented
in human history gave rise to a collection of both international and
national war crimes tribunals which confronted the horrors of war and
occupation, for the most part, in the name of humanity. Flawed though
they were and criticized by some as mere exercises in victor's justice,
no one can deny their impact on the entire postwar development of
international humanitarian law, the rise of human rights discourse, and
the birth of transitional justice as a distinct realm of political
activism, legal innovation and academic debate. If these early postwar
trials, from Nuremberg to Tokyo and from Norway to the Philippines
invoked a universalist vocabulary, the accused were limited, for the
most part, to the citizens of a relatively small number of recognized
aggressor nations. That the triumphant Allies did not supply suspects
for these trials from their own ranks has been often noted, but it was
Allied bomber pilots and Soviet foot soldiers whose presence were most
sorely missed by critics. Less attention was given by contemporaries and
historians since to the nationals of occupied lands who perpetrated
atrocities in the service of the occupier.

Few marked the absence in the great postwar tribunals of Chinese or
Burmese soldiers who fought side by side with Japanese forces, or argued
that Korean and Indian police who helped torture fellow Koreans or
Malayan prisoners might belong together with the accused guards of
prisoner of war camps. Many of the crimes that these allies of the
defeated powers could have been charged with such as torture, rape,
arson, murder and massacre, differed little from those committed by the
mostly German and Japanese combatants tried as war criminals. Around the
world the fate of most of these local nationals was determined by a
different set of rules, and their crimes were condemned and remembered
within the bounds of a radically different political discourse. With
some important exceptions, most of these forgotten “war criminals” were
merged into the much larger category of collaborator, and potentially
charged with the highest crime of nations: treason.

These atrocities of treason were more frequently interpreted by wartime
resistance members and early postwar regimes as expressions of their
betrayal rather than simple barbarity; their violence was seen as an
affirmation of their adherence to a despised enemy rather than a
rejection of human dignity. Thus anchoring their crimes in the mental
realms of fidelity and treachery, two seemingly contradictory approaches
emerged: the attempt to punish the atrocities of collaborators within
the highly political domain of treason prosecutions and an alternative
approach that emphasized the reformability of these otherwise valuable
human resources who had been poisoned by their association with the
enemy. This dissertation examines this peculiar politics of retribution
in several areas affected by Japanese occupation: the British Empire in
Asia, the Philippines, and Shandong, China.

In all of these places, the relationship between the crimes of betrayal
and occupation violence developed against a complex backdrop of
anti-colonial struggle or civil war. In every case there was a clear
tendency to separate out military and police forces that supported the
Japanese wartime empire from other accused traitors.[^^[1]^^](#_ftn1)
While these were the collaborators who were the most likely to have been
complicit in atrocities during the course of occupations and war, they
were also usually the most numerous in number, and thus both more useful
and dangerous to postwar regimes. In some late colonial settings such as
India and Burma, these wartime forces were also potentially admired for
their anti-colonial credentials.[^^[2]^^](#_ftn2) Plans to try many or
all of these military, police, and other security forces for their
wartime treason were either abandoned or, more often, transformed into
far smaller-scale treason trials for only those who were accused of
atrocities. The fact that these proceedings that punished crimes of
violence remained within a broader process of retribution against
treason and, in the case of the Philippines, some special
characteristics of the treason law itself, made this an even more flawed
environment in which to punish the crimes of war than the various
imperfect war crimes trials for enemy nationals that were being carried
out at the same time. Finally, efforts to reform and reintegrate
thousands of members of these forces, including the Indian National
Army, the Burma National Army, the Philippine Bureau of Constabulary,
and various Chinese armies who fought for Japan were aided by the
portrayal of their crimes primarily as a form of curable disease, or
else as victims of deception who could purge their treason with
patriotic acts of penitence.[^^[3]^^](#_ftn3)

The war with Japan, the brutality of its occupations, and the
simultaneity of the mass processes of retribution after its defeat help
bind the disparate contexts considered here together. Though certain
patterns of experience emerge from the comparative nature of this work,
the chapters that follow also reveal some of the ways the politics of
retribution after the Second World War had transnational and global
characteristics. Throughout the work I have endeavored to “emphasize the
persistent differences” that make these contexts unique and keep a
comparative historian honest.[^^[4]^^](#_ftn4) Both the scale and forms
of wartime violence, as well as the evidence available against those
accused of committing atrocities vary significantly, and this work is in
no way an attempt to relativize the severity of the wartime experience,
or engage in a calculus of moral responsibility. Instead, this work
seeks to open new avenues of discovery by highlighting the impact and
costs of the particular ways in which the atrocities of war were
addressed by resistance forces and victorious regimes.

Much of the retribution before and after the final days of the Second
World War was in the form of summary justice. These acts of revenge were
against individuals, suspect groups, or whole communities. They were
carried out by members of organized resistance forces, by victims, and
their relatives. In other cases, suspected collaborators may have
thought their own wartime conduct would be forgotten if they joined the
orgy of retributive violence. Retribution of this kind could often mask
a grab for political power, or even more often, personal or family
strife. It could be carried out without inconvenient court records,
witness testimony, or the rebuttal of the accused. These extra-judicial
killings are notoriously difficult to study. Through anecdotal evidence,
historians have determined the fact that retributive violence was
comparatively common in France, and less so in the Netherlands; rare in
southern Korea, but on a terrifying scale in British Malaya. However,
usable statistics are almost non-existent, and chasing these claims to
their footnotes often yield a few diaries as evidence for
generalizations covering highly diverse regions.

More than judging the scale, determining the motivations behind the
violence poses an even bigger challenge. Studies strongly rooted in a
locality that take into account the complex web of relationships in a
given area remain the best way to address the dynamics of this kind of
widely dispersed violence after war, and these are still few in number
for the areas once under Japanese occupation.[^^[5]^^](#_ftn5) Emerging
claimants on state power in the aftermaths of war can, however, have a
powerful impact on the wider processes of retributive violence. When
considering the case of Communist controlled areas of Shandong province
in Chapter Seven, the role of Party policy in facilitating or
restraining violence will be explored, but for the most part, this work
will focus on the politics of retribution which play out in the courts
and institutions of state and military power.

*Japanese Empires***

The wars of Japanese expansion and the momentous transitions which
accompanied Japan’s collapse in 1945 are what unite the chapters of this
work. When I speak of treason, for the most part it is treason in the
form of a collaboration with Japanese military forces. When I speak of
violence, in greater measure, I refer to the violence committed in the
context of Japanese occupations or the continuities in that violence
following the end of those occupations. However, the anchoring role
played by the expansion and collapse of the Japanese empire in this
dissertation is in one sense deceptive. The politics of retribution in
each chapter overlaps significantly with scholarship deeply informed by
three themes in which the Japanese empire plays a very different role:
1) the response to Western imperialism in Asia, 2) the unique
characteristics of the Japanese colonial experience, and 3) the
development of agrarian revolutions and the emergence of Cold War
divisions in Asia.

After invading northeast China in 1931 and establishing the client state
of Manchukuo      (滿洲國), the Japanese Army continued to weaken
Chinese sovereignty in northern China through a policy of supporting
autonomous breakaway administrations. After the outbreak of a full scale
Sino-Japanese war in 1937, when temporarily united Communist and
Nationalist Chinese forces refused to allow further encroachment,
Japanese forces soon found themselves deeply mired in a bloody
stalemate. American pressure, including a full oil embargo, forced Japan
to make a choice between a humiliating retreat or a preemptive attack to
cripple the U.S. Navy and capture the resource rich colonies of
Southeast Asia. The rapid “southern advance” of the Japanese military
beginning in December, 1941 swept aside the colonial governments of
Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. It completed Japanese
dominance in French Indochina, subjected a weak, if independent Thai
regime, and overthrew a Philippine Commonwealth waiting for its promised
independence from the United States. In British India, following a
failed attempt to reach a compromise with leading Indian nationalists to
secure support for British war efforts at the nadir of Allied fortunes
in August, 1942, the Indian National Congress launched a “Quit India”
movement. The movement called for an immediate end to colonial rule and
colonial authorities responded with a massive round-up of nationalist
leaders that led to a powerful outbreak of urban and later rural
violence.

For historians of empire in South and Southeast Asia as well as of the
nation-states that emerged following decolonization, the Pacific War
from 1941 to 1945 is an important, if brief, transitional moment which
serves primarily to inform a narrative of the fall of Western
imperialism. In the historiography of Japanese empire, however, these
final years of expansion were a desperate attempt by the empire to
preserve itself but, even more, a culminating moment of experimentation.
This took place at a time when, across the wartime empire, every last
resource was being extracted, forced labor conscripted on a mass scale,
and counter-insurgency campaigns were growing more and more desperate.
Nevertheless, historians have seen this as a moment when alternative
Japanese visions for a new political and cultural order in Asia came at
least one step closer to the promises of propaganda. Japanese military
leaders sometimes supported the anti-colonial aspirations found
throughout Southeast Asia. As defeat loomed, occupation governments
increasingly backed this support with limited devolutions of power,
including nominal independence for Burma and the Philippines in 1943.

This experience, especially in Southeast Asia, left a complex legacy.
The costs and consequences of trying murder, torture, and complicity in
wartime atrocities through treason trials and other special
collaboration tribunals in the early postwar period varied around the
world, as did the movements to reform and reintegrate military and
police collaborators. At the very least, however, trying individuals for
atrocities under the laws of treason in a colonial context posed a
particularly troubling phenomenon. It was not merely a question of
whether the accused could be expected to maintain wartime loyalty
towards their imperial masters. The hypocrisy became particularly
glaring in these cases since the treasonous sins were committed in the
context of what many saw as a *foreign occupation of a foreign
occupation*. Every moment spent emphasizing the horrors of the one—that
of the Japanese, could not but help remind everyone of the existence of
the other—British, French, Dutch, or American colonial rule, even if the
scale of violence and devastation was greater in one than in the other.
The effects of the *double occupations*of Asia had a strong impact on
the local response both during the war and in the politics of the
aftermath of Japan’s defeat.

These differing approaches to Japanese occupations and the Pacific
War–the Japanese occupation as a deviation from, or catalyst in, a
longer story of decolonization on the one hand, and a Japan-centered
story that considers the wartime empire as the final rise and fall of
certain pan-Asian ambitions on the other, both give rise to two
questions of influence that have received much attention. The first asks
what impact Japanese occupations and the war with Western empires had
upon existing anti-colonial movements and the end of colonialism
throughout the region. The second asks what, if any, Japanese occupation
institutions and ideas developed in this period may have contributed to
the formation of the post-colonial nation-state. Both of these are
important questions, but answers to them have often been limited to
studying networks of like-minded individuals, institutional histories,
and high politics.

If anything, this dissertation returns to an emphasis on the role of
violence. Almost everywhere the Japanese imperial army advanced,
atrocities and brutality followed, with the scale of physical violence
multiplying as Japan’s fortunes faltered and resistance grew. The
temporary alliances between anti-colonial forces and Japanese occupation
armies should not be recalled without also recalling their complicity in
the violence of those occupations, even as the repression of the Western
colonial rule they sought to overthrow is recognized. Similarly, when
evaluating the lasting influence of Japanese occupation period
institutions, it is worth considering the fate of security organs that
helped to maintain those occupations, and the individuals who carried
out its brutal tasks. At the same time, the differences between the
areas of “double occupation” in Southeast Asia, and the emerging postwar
societies of China, Taiwan, and Korea must also be taken into account.

In the historiography of Japan’s own colonial empire, the issue of
postwar continuities of violence has received extensive consideration,
no more so than in studies on Korea. Often this discussion builds upon
an understanding of a particularly Japanese form of colonialism. Unlike
the short occupations of Southeast Asia beginning with the rapid
advances of 1941, or the decade and a half of encroachment and military
occupation in China from 1931, Japan’s colonial rule in Okinawa,
Karafuto (South Sakhalin), Taiwan, and Korea stretched across multiple
decades and included an evolving policy of assimilation tailored to the
circumstances of each. These colonies were in close proximity to the
Japanese archipelago and were often tied in deep and complex ethnic and
cultural relationships with the metropole. Scholarship on Japanese
colonial history, as with studies of Russian imperialism, has often
focused upon its unique characteristics and contrasted it with the more
frequently juxtaposed empires of France, Britain, and the Netherlands.

If the wars of Japanese expansion are embedded in narratives of the fall
of western imperialism in South and Southeast Asia, or its organs of
repression analyzed in the context of a uniquely Japanese colonial
experience, in another body of scholarship, including the rich
historiography on the rise of the Chinese Communist Party, the
experience of Japanese occupation is primarily considered in its role as
a catalyst for revolution. To a greater or lesser extent, this is true
across the former Japanese empire. The massive social disruption of
Japanese military expansion, its relatively weak control beyond urban
centers of power, and its sudden demise all facilitated the rise of
powerful rural revolutionary movements that frequently married calls for
agrarian reform with calls for national liberation. If anti-colonial
forces sometimes sought to benefit from a “pact with the devil,” and
cooperated with Japanese occupiers, others such as the Chinese and
Malaysian Communists, the Philippine Hukbalahap, the Viet Minh, and even
Korean guerrillas in Manchuria developed valuable military and political
experience in the course of their resistance against it. Unsurprisingly,
they also refined their own organs of strict discipline and carried out
widespread liquidation of enemies justified by a quasi-permanent state
of crisis. In these narratives, however, Japan serves as what one might
call a *repressive constant*. When Japan is defeated, the role of this
constant source of repressive violence is merely swapped out and
fulfilled by the reactionary regime that is established in its place:
the Nationalist regime in China, the Philippine oligarchy, a US
supported right-wing regime in southern Korea, or returning French and
British empires, thus justifying the continued challenge to the state
posed by the wartime insurgency. For these revolutionary organizations
as well as many sympathetic to their cause, the taint of treason serves
well when hard evidence of specific atrocities or other acts of overt
oppression are not at hand.

*Chapter Overviews*

The opening chapter expands upon some of the issues brought up in this
introduction. It begins with a discussion of the problematic term
“collaboration” and some of the costs of adopting it as a framework of
research. Instead, this dissertation disaggregates the two primary
aspects of acts typically referred to by collaboration, violence and
betrayal. The remainder of the chapter provides a broader global
overview of the efforts to punish war crimes after the Second World War,
and the ways in which military and police allies of the defeated powers
were dealt with in Europe.

This is followed by three chapters, composing Part One of the
dissertation, which examine the British Empire’s approach to treason and
acts of brutality or other forms of illegitimate violence. British
policy towards its “Indian renegades,” especially the Indian National
Army that fought with the Japanese on the Burmese front, began with an
attempt to treat its traitors like men afflicted with a contagious
disease, and later evolved into an ambitious policy of mass trials. As
widespread opposition to the trials became evident, the thousands of
initially planned cases were gradually scaled down and transformed into
trials limited to military collaborators with Japan who were also
accused of atrocities, especially against British or Indian POWs. This
attempt failed with violent consequences within the Indian subcontinent
as the trials sparked protests, riots, and even helped inspire a naval
mutiny. Despite the shift to focus on atrocities, the most famous
opening trial not only retained the highly political crime of treason to
deliver a symbolic ruling on the treasonous nature of the Indian
National Army, but was among the weakest cases in terms of evidence for
accusations of prisoner murder and abuse. Thanks to the failures of this
initial trial and the tremendous response it inspired, the belated focus
on the brutality of some INA soldiers utterly failed to persuade India
that the effort was anything more than a dying empire’s feeble attempt
to tarnish one branch of the Indian independence movement.

 Chapter Three traces the impact of the evolving British response to the
Indian National Army on the cases of many other former British imperial
subjects who were guilty of more troubling crimes throughout the Empire,
including other “Indian renegades” who helped maintain Japanese military
occupations far away from the potential glories of the India-Burma
front. In British Malaya, Borneo, Hong Kong, and Singapore, the decision
was made to follow the Indian example and limit cases of treason to
those which included atrocities, with an exception for the case of
informers. While in principle this might have had the laudable effect of
creating a direct parallel to the war crimes tribunals of Japanese
soldiers being carried out throughout British Asia, the effect was more
to further weaken a process which was already low on the priority list
for colonial officials. Little detailed evidence of atrocities had been
gathered on the hundreds of suspected traitors in custody, whose
disloyalty alone was initially sufficient to secure their conviction.
The chapter closes by considering the fate of one other group of “Indian
renegades” beyond the subcontinent, some of whom faced no mercy at the
hand of a vengeful French resistance.

The fourth chapter turns to the case of Burma, where another treasonous
army, the Burma National Army, rebelled against the Japanese in time to
redeem itself partially in the eyes of the returning British officials.
The chapter contrasts the policies of American Counter-Intelligence
Corps agents, who pursued Burmese collaborators deep into the jungles of
northern Burma, with a returning British administration again
considering large scale trials for military collaborators–first for
treason and later only for those accused of atrocities. In Burma, the
issue was further complicated by the particularly strong ethnic
divisions that sometimes shaped wartime violence. Leaving these issues
unresolved, the entire process was completely derailed largely thanks to
a single inconvenient murder accusation against a traitor-turned-ally
who was too important to surrender to trial: Aung San.

Part two of the dissertation shifts away from the British Empire to look
at political retribution against military collaborators in the
Philippines. Chapter Five outlines the forms of military collaboration
with the Japanese occupation in the Philippines and introduces the ways
in which the collaboration issue has been framed in postwar Philippine
memory. Historical accounts of the trials of retribution against these
individuals usually come to an abrupt end in 1948 with the proclamation
of a presidential amnesty and the dismantling of the special People’s
Courts established to try collaboration cases. However, this chapter
takes a closer look at the debate in the Philippine legislature over
treason trials that ended in the confirmation of the amnesty, which
excluded cases of military collaborators and informers. While those
accused in cases not covered by the amnesty were directly responsible
for some of the most violent acts of the occupation, the structure of
the amnesty had the unsettling result of allowing almost all
elites–including those who had power over the security organs that
supported the Japanese occupation–to go unpunished. Meanwhile, treason
trials continued in regular criminal courts for the mostly rural and
lower class collaborators who worked in closest proximity with Japanese
soldiers and military police in their brutal counterinsurgency
campaigns.

The next chapter argues that the highly political crime of treason was
most unsuited to punishing war crimes of Filipinos guilty of acts
ranging from serving as informants, killing civilians, participating in
massacres, or coercing women into sexual slavery for the Japanese
military. Crimes of violence committed in the context of treason were,
under rules for “complex crimes,” held to the higher requirements for a
treason conviction. On the other hand, some individuals were found
guilty on determination of their membership in organizations alone,
while others, such as many accused Philippine constabulary members, were
seen as merely carrying out their policing duties, even if these were
under guidance of the Japanese military. Finally, in cases in which
Filipinos helped to secure sex slaves for the Japanese military, their
crime was not seen as sufficiently “political in nature” to merit
conviction as treason, while other acts of violence and coercion
qualified.

The third and final part of the dissertation shifts to focus greater
attention on efforts to reform and make use of those who had been
reviled and hated for their role in preserving oppressive Japanese
occupations. This approach was carried out throughout the areas already
covered in previous chapters, though the scale and leniency employed in
the efforts differed from case to case. Before the shift to a strategy
of prosecution, most captured members Indian National Army were either
directly redeployed or given an opportunity to be cured of their treason
in a “holiday camp.” Thousands of rehabilitated military collaborators
of Burma were allowed to join a new postwar Burmese Army on the eve of
independence, and most Philippine Bureau of Constabulary members were
merged into the postwar constabulary after passing “loyalty boards,”
with little effort made to determine their role in wartime atrocities.

The final chapter looks at a particularly elaborate campaign to secure
the wartime defection of military collaborators carried out by the
Chinese Communist Party in Shandong province. The Party portrayed its
Nationalist competitor as riddled with the remnants of military
“puppets” who fought side by side with the Japanese. However, the Party
separated its own “traitor elimination” efforts from its “enemy and
puppet work” in order to recruit and redeploy the universally reviled
military collaborators. The policy of extreme leniency for the poorly
trained and poorly armed client armies supporting the Japanese
occupation wavered around the time of Japanese surrender. Some military
collaborators unlucky enough to surrender or be captured in this
transitional period found themselves caught up in a violent campaign of
mass retribution against traitors.

*A Note on Sources*

Part One relies heavily on British imperial sources which come mostly
from the perspective of a colonizer evaluating its response to military
collaboration with Japan. These include the multi-volume document
collections *Transfer of Power 1942-7*, *Towards Freedom: Documents on
the Movement for Independence in India*, the five rich volumes of
documents in the *Indian National Army: A Documentary Study*, *Burma:
The Struggle for Independence 1944-1948: Documents from Official and
Private Sources*, and the microfiche collection of the *Indian Political
Intelligence (IPI) Files, 1912-1950*. Part Two on the Philippines makes
use of U.S. State Department documents in Record Group 59, debates in
the microfilm of the Philippine *Congressional Record: House of
Representatives*, the *Official Gazette*, and Supreme Court case rulings
found in the Philippine Laws and Jurisprudence Databank, or LawPhil
(http://lawphil.net/). Chapter Seven on the Enemy and Puppet Work Bureau
in Shandong, China, makes heavy use of wartime and early postwar
Communist Party documents found in the Shandong Provincial Archive, as
well as a published multi-volume collection of the archive’s documents,
*A Selection of Archive Materials on the History of the Revolution in
Shandong* (*Shandong Geming Lishi Dang’an Ziliao
Xuanbian*山東革命歷史檔案資料選編). It also uses materials from compiled
oral history collections known as *Historical Literature* (*Wenshi
Ziliao*文史資料) and local gazetteers now made available online by the
Shandong Provincial Gazetteer Office (山東省地方史志辦公室

**Chapter 1: Of Collaboration, War Crimes, and Treason**

*Collaboration and its Discontents*

A vile race of quislings – to use the new word which will carry the
scorn of mankind down the centuries – is hired to fawn upon the
conqueror, to collaborate in his designs, and to enforce his rule upon
their fellow-countrymen, while groveling low themselves. \
 - *Winston Churchill*(1941)\
 \

The scorn of mankind never quite latched onto the new word
quisling.[^^[6]^^](#_ftn6) Another word has largely taken its place,
collaborator. This dissertation is not about the moral dilemmas of
collaboration. It is about a politics of retribution in which atrocities
are punished as treason. Because it is difficult to speak of the latter
without some reference to the former, we must begin with a discussion of
that term which, more than any other, stands in the way of the goal of
this project. Collaboration is one of those concepts which, like the
serpent Ouroboros, circles the world only to devour itself. The more one
pursues it, the greater the struggle to prevent it from dissipating
completely as a useful category of analysis.

A growing body of scholarship that addresses collaboration as a
historical phenomenon often rests upon a form of equivocation,
alternately employing the term with one meaning and then another. The
most common way this is done is to begin with a specific definition of
collaboration as the provision of aid to a foreign occupier, but then
elsewhere employ the term in a more general way to describe acts which
make one complicit in the violence or oppression of any authority. An
illustration of this kind of move is found in a 2012 series of exchanges
in the *Journal of Asian Studies*on the ethics of collaboration between
John Whittier Treat, Timothy Brook, and Michael D.
Shin.[^^[7]^^](#_ftn7) The main historical cases that each focus upon
are colonial Korea and Japanese-occupied China. In his opening piece on
an important Korean literary figure who energetically supported the
Japanese empire, Yi Kwang-su, Treat introduces us to a wide world of
collaboration from the literary to the philosophical, and from the
pedagogic to the political. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of
collaboration portrayed: one that occupies a universal moral domain of
action and one which is tied to a particular form of illegitimate
relationship with an Other. An example of the first is found in his
quoting of Milan Kundera’s definition of collaboration, “putting oneself
voluntarily at the service of a vile power,” and Kundera’s observation
that, “we realize more and more that man’s activity is by nature a
collaboration.”[^^[8]^^](#_ftn8) This is a universal collaboration: a
sin we all bear when our actions as well as our inaction make us
complicit with the crimes of the state or, for example, the injustices
of an economic order we help sustain.

However, in choosing a Korean figure such as Yi who argued for complete
assimilation with Japan and supported its wartime empire, Treat notes
that “collaboration and its associated moral morass recede as an
issue—how does one collaborate with oneself?”[^^[9]^^](#_ftn9) Here is a
collaboration tied to identity; a moral morass that is dependent upon
the distinction between the collaborator and the power
served.[^^[10]^^](#_ftn10) Treat’s solution is to turn to the ethical
theories of the analytic philosophy tradition, using a consequentialist
approach to pass judgment on Yi’s choice to write passionate appeals on
behalf of the imperial cause. This approach, however, offers nothing to
distinguish the class of immoral acts Yi commits from those of, say, a
Japanese colonial official in Korea, or a novelist in rural Japan who
calls upon the youth of the countryside to sacrifice their lives for the
nation. Are they not all putting themselves at the service of a vile
power? Do their actions not lead to negative consequences?

The only meaningful way to distinguish their acts from those of Yi in
Treat’s moral mechanics is to privilege a loyalty to someone or
something, most often the nation. Timothy Brook points this out in his
response to Treat, which argues that collaboration is a troublesome lens
for moral reflection. It continues to depend, “for its conceptual
coherence” on nationalism. It was nationalism which had demanded, “a new
concept redolent of improper liaisons and denied parentage, and
collaboration became nationalism’s evil twin.”[^^[11]^^](#_ftn11)
Brook’s alternative, seen in his own study of local collaboration in
occupied China is not, however, the universal collaboration with evil
that Kundera describes. The sense of an “improper liaison” does not
completely disappear when the term’s connection to the nation-state is
severed. In his careful attempts to disentangle the strands of
complicity, contingency, and unexpected outcomes in the specific cases
of individuals, the unique positionality of a collaborator in an
occupation setting is repeatedly emphasized. Indeed, Brook defines
collaboration itself narrowly, following the Danish historian Henrik
Dethlefsen, as the “continuing exercise of power” while under the
coercion of an occupying force.[^^[12]^^](#_ftn12) While avoiding any
attachment of weight to national loyalty, the collaborator is described
as caught in a “parasitic political engagement produced by the
cancellation of sovereignty” and faced with the usually hopeless task of
bridging the gap between the illegitimate occupation state and the
occupied population.[^^[13]^^](#_ftn13)

This is still something very distinct from the presumably more natural
engagement between, for example the Japanese civilians employed in
“pacification teams” throughout occupied China and the Japanese military
with which they worked. If the *Chinese* identity of the collaborator
was not relevant, their state of *occupation* was. The historian of
German and Soviet occupied Poland, Jan T. Gross, also emphasizes this
context, concluding that, “inasmuch as it denotes a set of relationships
between the occupiers and the occupied *mediated by a set of officially
existing institutions*, collaboration must be an occupier-driven
phenomenon.”[^^[14]^^](#_ftn14) For Gross, what made collaboration a
unique part of a Second World War Europe host to the Holocaust was a
different sort of gap: the one which opened up between the tolerable
“terms of initial commitment” made by the collaborator to the occupation
state, and the terrifying end result.[^^[15]^^](#_ftn15) We might call
these two similar approaches to collaboration, which endeavor to
carefully sever the connection with issues of identity and betrayal in
order to highlight the unique challenges faced by a population under
foreign domination, *occupation-collaboration*.

As the gaps described by Gross and Brook suggest, emphasizing the
positionality of individuals operating under foreign occupation allows
the historian to focus in upon the devastating impact of international
wars and the jarring spectacle of an invaded people engaging at deep
disadvantage with a completely new set of powerful actors. Depending on
the object of one’s research, this approach can serve well, but it can
also come at a cost. Hilary Conroy pointed out some of these problems
long ago. He suggested, as does Treat for the Korean case, that
collaboration has a very awkward place at the table in a mid-twentieth
century Asia full of colonies. Even without taking the problem of
identity into account, the colonial setting strains the term occupation,
and leaves the discussion in “shambles.” For Conroy, this problem
emerges from the fact that the phenomenon of collaboration is so deeply
rooted in the experiences of the Second World War, and specifically its
“Nazi-European context.”[^^[16]^^](#_ftn16)

Beyond the difficulty of applying its use to colonial contexts, a
problem we will revisit below, occupation-collaboration runs into
difficulty when applied to earlier historical examples that long predate
the rise of the modern nation-state. Despite the fact almost every piece
on collaboration refers to the emergence of this term in 1940, when the
French Marshal Pétain announced his collaboration with the German
occupiers, any claim that the acts collaboration refer to are distinctly
modern is an exercise in pure tautology. Historians of ancient Chinese
and Greek history can supply many examples. And yet, attempts to explore
these older cases and their moral dilemmas without serious consideration
of community identity and the sense of betrayal of, for example, a group
of oligarchs who open the city gates to an invading army, is to miss
something absolutely central about the way the event was perceived and
remembered by its contemporaries. Just as a historian acknowledges the
normative principles that guide them in the formulation of their
questions and the whole course of their approach, we must also recognize
the gap this creates between us and the subjects we write about. We are
no less bound than the moral philosopher addressed by Judith Shklar in
her memorable appeal,

No theory of either justice or injustice can be complete if it does not
take account of the sense of injustice. It is, indeed, one of the
failings of the normal model of justice that it does not do so. It does
not give injustice its due because it does not consider the sentiments
that make us cry out for revenge, and if that is denied, for justice.
Too complacent, it forgets the irrationality, fear, indifference and
inequality which give injustice its power.[^^[17]^^](#_ftn17) \
 \

What of the postwar period? There have been military occupations since
1945, and both Iraqi and Afghan collaborators await anxiously today to
see what the future has in store for them, but it seems strangely
arbitrary to limit the term collaboration to the relatively small number
of foreign invasions in the second half of the twentieth century, when
so many other cases seem to produce similar moral dilemmas. Is the long
Communist interlude in Eastern Europe only to be incorporated into
debates over collaboration because it included a Soviet military
occupation? Why not speak of collaboration in the context of brutal
civil wars where there is no truly foreign occupier? What of
collaboration with a newly formed military dictatorship that has
retained an existing bureaucracy? What of collaboration with American
empire? Finally, why not include our persistent inaction in the face of
social injustice?[^^[18]^^](#_ftn18) The problem is, of course, that
each broader category of cases we include brings us closer to Kundera’s
understanding of the collaborator as a universal archetype: the
reluctant or enthusiastic accomplice, the fellow if subordinate
conspirator, the complicit bystander; the guilty and the damned.

In many of these cases we find something similar to the gap between the
occupied and a state that lacks or has lost all legitimacy. We also
often find a terrible contrast between the “terms of initial commitment”
and the final result, even if this contrast rarely, if it ever can,
rises to the scale of horror found in the Holocaust. Most importantly,
in each case that includes oppression and atrocity the historian must,
as in the case of military occupations, consider the complicity of
actors who may themselves have directly carried out crimes, indirectly
facilitated them, or whose inaction might be judged unforgivable.

Now, though, the dissipation is near complete, and the word
collaboration simply becomes another word for moral complicity. If
collaboration is almost everywhere, and in such a wide range of
contexts, it fails to capture something distinct that a more
restrictive, if arbitrary, definition of occupation-collaboration
offered. It is something that is always there in
occupation-collaboration, nagging the historian from behind. It is
something occupation-collaboration yields not because of the virtue of
its conceptual integrity but because all of the cases it does include
share the very thing it sought to remove from consideration in the first
place: betrayal.

This brings us full circle. When Philippe Pétain used the word
“collaboration” to describe a defeated France’s new relationship with
Germany, that term stood out so memorably because it was widely seen as
an attempt to conceal a vile act of treason as an innocuous partnership.
The Western world was witness not to the birth of a new concept but a
new deceit, a new euphemism for infidelity which only gradually spread
in use beyond French and English. It is true that the “conceptual
coherence” of the term collaboration depended on nationalism, but it was
more than that. Its ability to stand in for treason served Pétain, the
resistance, and historians alike. It replaced an ancient set of words
denoting betrayal with a modern and international alternative. In the
decades since the war, with nationalism in the dock and the focus
shifted to an accounting of the unparalleled violence of the Second
World War, the wartime traitors could be condemned again under a new
indictment. Even so, it has never gained full global currency as a
concept. Its equivalent words in other languages have not played a
central role in the debates in many of the countries grappling with
wartime crimes.[^^[19]^^](#_ftn19) Indeed, it appears only rarely in the
sources used throughout this dissertation, even when those sources were
composed in English. Though the term collaboration continues to spread,
in many places, the discussion remains now, as it did then, for the most
part unashamedly about treason, or other nouns identifying the
perpetrators of national betrayal.

In sum, collaboration obscures more than it explains. Attempts to
preserve its contextuality trap the historian in a nationalist or at
least identity-centric frame. Attempts to escape this frame result in a
still-normatively-loaded concept that is either generalized to the point
of uselessness, or arbitrarily confined to the very contexts that
defined the original frame. Instead of using the framework of
collaboration, this dissertation considers the relationship between the
two core components that has driven so much of what has been written on
the topic: betrayal and the sense of an illicit relationship on the one
hand, and complicity in oppression and atrocity on the other. The
outpouring of retributive violence and calls for justice in the
aftermath of Japanese surrender in 1945 that are the primary
consideration in this dissertation cannot be explained without
considering both. Most important of all, however, a focus upon the
relationship *between* the two allows us to treat post-liberation
societies not merely as dramatically transformed environments—though
this is not to underestimate the importance of this break, but as
environments that often posed challenges similar to occupation period
itself.

I have not removed the word collaborator everywhere it makes its
appearance in this dissertation. It remains one convenient word among
several used in the chapters that follow to distinguish a group of
actors who are, at various points, accused of treason or violent crimes.
If I seem cavalier in calling individuals renegades, traitors, puppets,
and the like, following their accusers, it is because these characters
are not the main protagonists of this story. This is the other sense in
which this dissertation is not about collaboration: it is not the moral
dilemmas and crimes of those who aided the Japanese occupations which
are the main concern in what follows. They are of course important, but
in this study of the politics of retribution, the focus is upon the
judges and their relationship with the accused, not upon the accused and
their relationship to the victims.

*War Crimes and Treason***

Treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages and
mischiefs to this nation, acted and committed in the said wars, or
occasioned thereby. - *The Indictment of Charles
I*(1648)[^^[20]^^](#_ftn20)\
 \

The tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo were the most ambitious
international effort to try the crimes of war, and the last to do so
until the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia in 1993.[^^[21]^^](#_ftn21) Building on the provisions
of Hague conventions at the opening of the twentieth century, the
influence of the Lieber Code in the American Civil War, and older
traditions dating back to the Middle Ages, the early post World War II
tribunals included two new categories of crimes. The first of these laid
out in the 8 August, 1945 London Charter, crimes against peace, was
defined as the “planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of
aggression.”[^^[22]^^](#_ftn22) The second, crimes against humanity, was
defined as, “murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other
inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or
during the war; or persecutions on political, racial or religious
grounds…”[^^[23]^^](#_ftn23) In particular, the prosecution of crimes
against humanity, with its focus on large scale atrocities against
civilians, would go on to have a strong impact on the 1949 Geneva
Conventions, the 1951 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide, the 1987 Convention Against Torture, as well as
almost all of the national and international trials for atrocities in
recent decades.[^^[24]^^](#_ftn24)

The total number of individuals tried in the two international tribunals
after the Second World War amounted to only a few dozen individuals,
with the latter Tokyo-based tribunal, officially the International
Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), trying 28 Japanese military
and civilian leaders. The main emphasis of both trials was the
prosecution of leading figures of the defeated powers accused of crimes
against peace. Both of these international tribunals were supplemented
by national-level trials or military tribunals involving thousands of
suspects accused of conventional war crimes and crimes against humanity
throughout Europe and Asia. In the case of the former Japanese wartime
empire, these trials have become generally referred to as the “BC war
crimes” trials and include American military tribunals in Manila,
Yokohama, and Shanghai, as well as British, Australian, Canadian, New
Zealand, Dutch, French, Russian and Chinese trials. Though the A, B, and
C categories were described in some contemporary press reports as a
reference to higher and lower priority suspects, the BC designation
stemmed from the fact these national-run trials did not include the
“crimes against peace” that were the highlight of the IMTFE, and which
constituted the first of three categories of crimes consistently
mentioned in various Allied documents.[^^[25]^^](#_ftn25)

The IMTFE, and far more so the combination of the international tribunal
at Nuremberg and the dozen other U.S. military trials also held there,
have received the most attention of historians. This consideration is
well merited given both the contemporary interest in the trials and
their long-term impact on international law. The trials would leave a
legacy of influence on a wide range of legal issues ranging from the
nature of aggressive war, the introduction of individual responsibility
into international law, and the identification of combatants. They also
addressed inadequacies of international law in protecting civilians from
reprisals, and most of all the trials would serve as a profoundly
important precedent in its response to the mass persecution—including
genocide—of whole groups.

To a significantly greater extent than in the German trials, which were
held in the aftermath of an unprecedented campaign of mass extermination
of the Jews of Europe, in the Tokyo tribunal the men in the dock were at
some considerable distance from the acts of violence presented by the
many delegations at the tribunal. The considerable legal and rhetorical
contortions required to assign responsibility to those in the dock not
only for criminal negligence and command responsibility, but also for a
planned conspiracy to commit mass atrocities and global conquest, was
likewise significantly more complex.[^^[26]^^](#_ftn26) Partly as a
result of this, the trials have left a particularly troubled legacy in
Japan, where they have become a popular starting point for revisionist
historians and apologists for Japan’s wartime empire.[^^[27]^^](#_ftn27)

Less attention, on the other hand, has been given to the national-level
trials which included many of the soldiers, military police, and others
who were most directly involved in the torture, massacre, and rape
associated with Japanese occupations throughout East and Southeast
Asia.[^^[28]^^](#_ftn28) If the main international tribunals struggled
to tie distant events together in a chain of responsibility and mass
conspiracy, the national-level trials were faced with the many practical
challenges of sorting through the evidence and managing these
proceedings with limited resources in liberated areas struggling to
rebuild.

Beyond these problems of evidence and procedure, both the national-level
war crimes trials and the international tribunals sparked decades of
discussion over the selection of the accused. These debates were not
only about those who were included, but even more about those who were
left out. We can broadly speak of three general kinds of absence from
both the international and national trial process: 1) large numbers of
enemy nationals equally or more culpable than those who were tried, 2)
Allied solders and government leaders who were guilty of any of the
three major categories of crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes
against humanity, 3) in most cases, nationals of those countries
occupied during the war.

In the first instance, the trials did not simply fail to include a few
missing targets, but left out the majority of the most notorious figures
of Second World War. After the main international tribunal for leading
figures at Nuremberg, for example, the U.S. Military tribunals
established there tried only 177 of some 2,500 “major war criminals”
selected by the Chief Counsel of War Crimes.[^^[29]^^](#_ftn29) In
Tokyo, the remarkable exclusion of the Japanese emperor in the trials
was orchestrated through the cooperation of the Allies and the very
loyal servants of the throne who faced charges in his
stead.[^^[30]^^](#_ftn30) Also protected from trial under
American-supplied immunity were agents and doctors of Unit 731, which
carried out medical atrocities and biological
warfare.[^^[31]^^](#_ftn31)

A second absence was that of Allied forces and their leaders. As
commentators since have often pointed out, none of the international or
national trials in the early postwar period included prosecutions of
Allied military or civilian personnel or representatives of the many
resistance forces whose very operations depended upon the violation of
the laws of war.[^^[32]^^](#_ftn32) From our perspective today, when
several dozen states, including India and China, are not signatories to
the International Criminal Court and several dozen others that have
signed the treaty, such as the United States and Russia, have no
intention of ratifying it, it does not seem terribly surprising to find
that the victorious Allies of the Second World War would exempt
themselves entirely from the process.

The singular evil that was the Holocaust also colors our perspective on
the early postwar trials in a way that makes the absence of Allied
suspects less remarkable, but it should be noted that the trials at
Nuremberg considered the extermination of the Jews as only one of many
crimes, and it was by no means the main focus.[^^[33]^^](#_ftn33) At
both international tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo, if there was a
central unifying narrative, it was that of illegal aggression; to judge
enemy nations who rose to power through the terrorization of their own
people, pursued world conquest and, wherever they could, established
occupations that ignored the laws of civilization. In Europe, article
six of the London Charter of 8 August, 1945 defined its jurisdiction
over the “trial and punishment of the major war criminals of the
European Axis countries” or those who were “acting in the interests” of
the European Axis powers. Article five of the charter for the IMTFE
changed this wording slightly and detached it from explicit reference to
any country. It granted the tribunal “the power to try and punish Far
Eastern war criminals,” suggesting either a geographic or perhaps even a
racial definition for its jurisdiction. Despite this ambiguity in
wording of Tokyo trials charter, however, there is little doubt who the
intended targets were, Japan and the agents of its empire.

During the trials the absence of prosecutions for Allied war crimes was
often used by the defense attorneys to divert guilt and point out the
hypocrisy of the trials; a “you, too” or *tu quoque* defense. This was
the case when attorneys for Karl Dönitz pointed out that the Allies also
embraced the unrestricted submarine warfare included as a crime in the
admiral’s indictment, or when other counsel for the defense pointed out
the horrors of the destruction of Dresden by fire bombing when
confronted with their own atrocities.[^^[34]^^](#_ftn34) Judges pointed
out the hypocrisy as well. Robert H. Jackson, the leading U.S.
Prosecutor at Nuremberg, admitted in a letter to U.S. President Truman
that French mistreatment of prisoners of war, Allied plunder, and the
Soviet occupation of the Baltic states made the Allies guilty of some of
the crimes he was prosecuting, and this included only crimes perpetrated
after German surrender.[^^[35]^^](#_ftn35) In Tokyo, the famous
dissenting opinion of the Indian judge Radhabinod Pal, who found all
accused Japanese suspects innocent, strongly condemned the U.S. use of
atomic weapons and of the aggression represented by Western colonialism.

What these criticisms all shared was the lack of any serious proposal
that Allied forces actually be tried. The most narrowly defined range of
conventional war crimes went unaddressed. Given the completely
unrealistic prospect of Allied governments subjecting themselves to
trial over key elements of wartime policy that unambiguously constituted
crimes against humanity or crimes against peace, let us for the moment
exclude them. Let us exclude the strategic bombing of large urban areas,
the devastating flooding caused by the Chinese Nationalist destruction
of the Yellow River dikes or the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. Each of these resulted in the mass murder of hundreds of
thousands of civilians. Let us exclude the numerous illegal invasions by
the Allies of neutral countries stretching from Iceland to the
Baltics.[^^[36]^^](#_ftn36) Let us grant the impossibility of
colonialism itself joining the list of crimes prosecuted. We are still
left with “conventional” war crimes committed by individual Allied
soldiers or units both during the war and during the many new
occupations established as the Axis powers were
defeated.[^^[37]^^](#_ftn37)

As John Dower has pointed out, there was a universal tendency in the war
to see atrocities by one’s own side as episodic, while those of the
enemy were “systematic and revealed a fundamentally perverse national
character.”[^^[38]^^](#_ftn38) However, the scale of rape by Soviet
soldiers in areas it occupied in Europe, Manchuria, and northern Korea
rose well beyond isolated acts to suggest massive criminal negligence on
the part of the commanders who failed to prevent or act aggressively
against it.[^^[39]^^](#_ftn39) Mortality rates for German and Japanese
prisoners of war under Soviet control were extremely high with over a
third of German prisoners and an estimated hundred thousand Japanese
soldiers dying in captivity. Even the 2.58% of Germans who died in
French camps was, as we saw above, recognized by some as
unacceptable.[^^[40]^^](#_ftn40) These deaths cannot be dismissed as
isolated incidents. They were the result of poorly or deliberatively
adopted policies. Likewise, both Allied fighter pilots and their
commanders must share responsibility for the widespread strafing of
civilians and refugees, especially when orders were issued to shoot
anything that moved.[^^[41]^^](#_ftn41) The common mutilation of enemy
corpses to collect battlefield trophies in the Pacific was certainly no
torture to the living, but it was also a clearly established war crime,
nonetheless.[^^[42]^^](#_ftn42)

When it came to the punishment of the rarer cases of individual
massacres carried out by Allied forces, the perpetrators could attempt
to deny them completely and blame the enemy, as in the infamous case of
the execution in Katyn forest of thousands of Polish officers, police,
and intellectuals. Alternatively, the Allies could argue that the
regular processes of military justice were more than fair enough to try
forces guilty of the crimes of war. Unlike Japanese and German
court-martials, or the almost non-existent investigative efforts of the
Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, many individual Allied atrocities resulted
in some kind of punitive response. For example, the first British war
crimes trial held in Singapore of Japanese soldiers accused of abusing
Indian POWs took place at the same time as two British soldiers were
being court-martialed in Malaya for abusing Japanese
POWs.[[43]](#_ftn43) There are also the more famous cases of the Biscari
massacre by U.S. soldiers of several dozen Italian POWs in 1943, and the
rapes and killings committed by French-Moroccan colonial troops after
the fall of Monte Cassino in 1944. Both least resulted in
arrests.[^^[44]^^](#_ftn44) However, the troubled outcomes in these
latter cases, one ending in a shameful whitewash and the other in
arbitrary and injust summary executions, suggest some of the broader
problems of letting militaries judge their own atrocities in the
field.[^^[45]^^](#_ftn45) Ultimately, civilians and prisoners of war of
the defeated Axis, and indeed the subjects of any of the new postwar
occupations had very little recourse for justice.

It is the third group of individuals absent from the war crimes
proceedings that is the focus of this dissertation: those who committed
atrocities as allies of the defeated enemy nations, but who were not
among its citizens. They were ones who were despised both for their
betrayal and for their brutality. Many of them did face retribution in
the aftermath of war but none of them came before the international
tribunals. Only a small number came before the national-level war crimes
trials after the war. Instead, the vast majority of those guilty of, or
complicit in atrocities of wartime occupations were tried in special or
regular courts operating under newly passed laws for treason or related
crimes of collaboration. In these trials, the crime of treason rarely
stood by itself. To it were frequently added other charges such as
murder, torture, or other ‘mischief to the nation,’ but rarely was there
any doubt what their original sin was.

There were some exceptions. In the Soviet Union, areas under Soviet
occupation, or where the Communist party was strong, there were wartime
collaborators tried as war criminals. In some cases, these trials or
purges made little distinction between the name of the crime and its
content, while elsewhere they led to some of the only examples of war
crimes prosecutions of local nationals after the Second World War.
Before the full Communist takeover, the People’s Courts of Hungary tried
thousands of Hungarians for war crimes and crimes against humanity, even
if the same individuals were also referred to as traitors on other
occasions. Its judges offered a rare clarification for why its
defendants were not tried under other national laws. The defendants,
“charged with war crimes, and crimes against the people, attacked and
endangered not only the constitution and political system of their own
country but international law and the peace of civilized humanity as
well.”[^^[46]^^](#_ftn46)

In Finland, which was under heavy Soviet pressure to carry out a purge
after its wartime alliance with Germany, there was a remarkable series
of domestic war crimes trials involving over 3,000 cases of Finnish
nationals charged with atrocities, though these trials are all but
forgotten in comparison with the better known prosecution of Finnish
wartime leaders for the unusual crime of “having responsibility for the
war.”[^^[47]^^](#_ftn47) In Czechoslovakia, a June 1945 “Great Decree”
that set up 24 People’s Courts clearly separated a category of
treasonous “crimes against the state” from the separate categories of
crimes against persons and property. A legal infrastructure was
therefore at least in place for the isolation of atrocities from the
political crime of treason.[^^[48]^^](#_ftn48) In Yugoslavia, in
addition to tens of thousands of military collaborators summarily
executed by partisans at the end of the war, military court-martials
tried a number of notorious figures of the Croatian Ustaša movement as
war criminals rather than traitors.[^^[49]^^](#_ftn49)

In some cases, any attempt to categorize the crimes tried is futile. In
Bulgaria, following the army and Fatherland Front coup of September,
1944, the main thrust of retribution was on a sweep of ‘fascist’
elements. The Front’s purge sought to “eradicate fascist obscurantism,
the racial hatred, and the humiliation of the national honour of our
people,” and the extensive purges that followed made little attempt to
distinguish crimes of national betrayal, political heresy, or wartime
atrocities.[^^[50]^^](#_ftn50) In Romania, the early postwar purge also
made few clear distinctions, variously designating its targets,
including the wartime dictator Ion Antonescu, as fascists, nationalists,
anti-Semites, traitors, exploiters, or war criminals.[^^[51]^^](#_ftn51)
When the Communist party took full control in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, trials there also increasingly adopted the full lexicon
of Soviet purges to try its enemies of the state.

Another exception, found often in the European context, came from
individuals living in one of the occupied nations, but of German
citizenship, or ethnic origin. There were a number of ethnic Germans or
half-Germans born or raised in prewar countries such as Russia, England,
Argentina, Romania, Brazil, and Poland who were tried for war crimes in
the U.S. military tribunals at Nuremberg.[^^[52]^^](#_ftn52) Similar
cases can be found in other national-level war crimes trials around
Europe with varying outcomes. Some were tried as enemy war criminals,
others as traitors. In Denmark, nearly a quarter of the entire German
minority in the southern Schleswig region was convicted of
treason.[^^[53]^^](#_ftn53) Austria, which had the difficult task of
reinventing itself as a victim of foreign invasion despite widespread
enthusiasm for its annexation by Germany in 1938, did not go so far as
to punish its atrocities as crimes of national betrayal. It convicted
over 13,000 of war crimes in unusually long-lasting special courts from
1945 until the end of the Allied occupation in 1955.[^^[54]^^](#_ftn54)
In Norway, a number of German-born interpreters and police officers who
fell under the jurisdiction of the Norwegian treason law due to long
residency in the country faced an unusual fate. Tried and convicted as
traitors, those not executed were deported from Norway at the conclusion
of their sentence, along with all other convicted German war criminals.
These men, who often had no ties to the land they were ‘returned’ to,
were then added to the official Norwegian statistics for war
criminals.[^^[55]^^](#_ftn55)

Elsewhere, the German origin of prisoners became a point of contestation
at trial. During the trial of Waffen-SS soldiers who carried out the
murder of prisoners of war known as the Malmedy Massacre, all the
defendants were convicted except one, the Alsace-born Marcel Boltz.
Recruited after the annexation of Alsace by Germany, the newly recovered
French citizenship of Boltz in 1945 secured him an acquittal following
an appeal of the French government through the U.S. State
Department.[^^[56]^^](#_ftn56) We will have occasion to touch upon a few
similarly complex cases in the Philippines and China in the chapters
below.

The final important exception is the case of the military auxiliaries
and colonial soldiers of Japan. While both Koreans and a few Taiwanese
would face treason trials after the war, in Chinese, Dutch, Australian,
British, and American courts they were charged with war crimes. Although
Allies often segregated these colonial prisoners from the Japanese, and
Korea’s independence had been promised “in due course” at the Cairo
Conference in 1943, in the trials they were treated as enemy subjects.
As one British diplomat wrote of the difficult to categorize prisoners
in December, 1945, “The onus is clearly on the Korean and Formosan
concerned to prove to our satisfaction that he is not, in fact, a
Japanese in sheep’s clothing. We believe there is evidence, for
instance, to show that Koreans, in particular, have been amongst the
most brutal and cruel of the guards set over our prisoners in the
Southern regions and we must be in a position to treat such persons as
Japanese war criminals.”[^^[57]^^](#_ftn57)

Eventually 148 Korean and 173 Taiwanese conscripted auxiliaries and
volunteer soldiers were convicted of war crimes, many of them for crimes
of torture, murder and abuse while serving as guards in the prisoner of
war camps.[^^[58]^^](#_ftn58) Those that were not executed faced
ostracization after release without gaining any of the veterans benefits
other Japanese war criminals would receive after their
release.[^^[59]^^](#_ftn59) Sympathizers have pointed out the “double
pain” of conscription and conviction as war criminals that the Korean
and Taiwanese faced, but increasingly the emphasis on the injustices of
their postwar fate has drawn attention away from the wartime brutality
many of them undoubtedly perpetrated.[^^[60]^^](#_ftn60) The torturer
has become a victim. This is nowhere better seen than in the example of
a 2006 Korean truth commission composed of scholars and government
officials which pronounced all convicted Korean war criminals
innocent.[^^[61]^^](#_ftn61)

In most cases after the Second World War, including all of the areas
under Japanese control, citizens who had served in enemy police or
military units, or were otherwise accused of complicity in atrocities,
faced legal retribution through special courts or military
court-martials for treason.[^^[62]^^](#_ftn62) In Belgium, military and
guards who “took up arms against the Belgian State” constituted the most
serious among four categories of collaboration in a December, 1942
decree, and there was to be no distinction between higher and lower
officers. Some 31,821 Belgians were convicted of some form of “military
collaboration,” which made up more than half the convictions in the
military tribunals established.[^^[63]^^](#_ftn63) In Denmark too, 9,500
convicted military, police and security force collaborators composed the
majority of the roughly 13,500 convicted of treason, but in regular
criminal courts.[^^[64]^^](#_ftn64) In the Netherlands, cases for
wartime crimes were funneled through six Special Courts for treason and
collaboration. The most frequent convictions in the courts were for
volunteer military and police collaborators, whose guilt was established
in some cases by simple identification of them in uniform. Regular Dutch
police, however, who helped achieve the highest roundup rates Jews in
Western Europe, were exempt from the trials as long as they refused
membership in the Dutch National Socialist movement.[^^[65]^^](#_ftn65)

A similar pattern for military and police collaborators is found in
Norway. Over 5,000 Norwegians who fought in various German military or
Waffen-SS units were automatically guilty of treason according to
Norwegian law by virtue of membership in a treasonous organization. Some
4,272 were convicted under a separate charge for giving “aid to the
enemy” and imprisoned or given terms of forced labor.[^^[66]^^](#_ftn66)
Special state police who were crucial in helping Germany exterminate
almost half of Norway’s Jews were also convicted for treason, but the
judges were primarily interested in their betrayal of the nation and
sympathy for fascism, paying far less attention to the horrible outcome
of their collaboration.[^^[67]^^](#_ftn67) In both Norway and Denmark,
these treason trials were held in regular courts with the benefit of
wartime legislation to buttress prewar treason laws.[^^[68]^^](#_ftn68)

In France too, atrocities were punished within a process of retribution
against treason. Gestapo agents and militia (*Milice*) members who
escaped summary execution upon capture were charged with additional
crimes of murder and torture, but within the *cours de justice*
established by a June 1944 ordinance to punish acts of collaboration.
These courts handed out execution sentences for betrayal alone as well
as of betrayal combined with acts of violence.[^^[69]^^](#_ftn69) Tried
under a single judge and four lay jurors who were representatives of the
resistance, all convictions of these early postwar *cours de justice*
included the crime of “national indignity.”[^^[70]^^](#_ftn70) In Greece
too, trials were held under a constitutional act providing “Sanctions On
Those Who Have Collaborated with the Enemy,” with the accused being
divided into three groups according to which enemy the nation had been
betrayed to: Bulgaria, Germany, or Italy.[^^[71]^^](#_ftn71) As the
country plunged into civil war, proceedings against wartime traitors
were quickly surpassed in scale by a treason of a different sort—that of
Communists and their suspected sympathizers.[^^[72]^^](#_ftn72) In a
move that would be recognizable to critics of the U.S. occupation in
southern Korea, the British Army actively protected and helped
rehabilitate Greek police and army units who had served under the
occupiers.[^^[73]^^](#_ftn73)

In most countries across Europe military and police forces that worked
with wartime occupations came in closest contact with their violence and
repression. Every day they faced a choice of whether to participate in
that violence, facilitate it, ignore it, or suffer the consequences of a
bolder alternative. These were moral choices they faced, just as German
soldiers and Gestapo officers faced them. However, in the aftermath of
war military and police collaborators were judged not solely upon
whether they committed torture or facilitated massacre. They were judged
on whether they arrested insurgents *for*the occupier; whether they
committed torture *on behalf* of the Germans; and whether they
facilitated massacres *by*the enemy. Their crimes almost never stood
alone and were linked closely to their betrayal. In the territories that
emerged from the grip of Japan’s wartime empire that are the focus in
this dissertation, we find a similar pattern in the response of postwar
regimes, even when it was a returning empire. The atrocities committed
by nationals of the occupied territories almost always became deeply
intertwined with the efforts to punish betrayal of the
nation.[^^[74]^^](#_ftn74) This was seen as perfectly natural to the
various parties involved in the process in 1945. Indeed, it may continue
to seem perfectly natural, partly because of the persistence of the
broader concept of collaboration, and behind it nationalism, as the
primary lens through which to consider their acts. Each of the following
chapters examines some of the consequences of taking this approach in
wartime and during the early postwar period.

Beyond the immediate costs, however, was a longer legacy. Whatever their
faults, war crimes trials sent a clear message that certain forms of
conduct were no longer tolerable and lacked all legitimacy. Neither the
Allies with their bloody hands, or those who pointed out their hypocrisy
at the time fundamentally opposed the basic principles established. If
atrocities, tortures, and though less common, outright invasions
continued to be prominent features of the second half of the century,
they did so in the shadow of a powerful international human rights
discourse that would come to full maturity in the 1980s. One of the
tragedies of retribution in the name of treason after Japan’s defeat in
Asia, as well as in Europe, was that this declaration of the fundamental
illegitimacy of torture, summary execution, and mass atrocity was not
*amplified* in the domestic setting where the nationals of each country
were tried. Insofar as the primary crime was that of betrayal, it was
that much easier to come away from the war, as some surely did, with the
view that resistance forces, or postwar successor states continued to be
bound by a simpler logic within the realm of civil conflict. Our torture
is justifiable, our prisoners do not deserve protection, and our
liquidations are necessary—if only the nation is saved.

**Part I: Renegade Politics and Retribution in the British Empire**

\

Part One of the dissertation looks at the “renegades” of the British
Empire who fought together with the Japanese. It examines the evolving
efforts to punish mostly military collaborators in India and Burma, and
the impact of policy established in India upon the broader retributive
process in Southeast Asia after the war. In all of these cases, the
people of the invaded territories emerged at the end of the conflict not
as a people free and self-determined, but instead were turned over once
again to their old imperial ruler, Britain. As we shall see, this
impacted both the wartime choices of nationalist leaders from each of
Britain’s colonies, as well as the postwar response of the returning
empire.

The claims that treason charges in this complex environment was unjust
was not unique to margins of empire. The European attempts to punish
military and police collaborators through the laws of national betrayal
that we saw in the previous chapter occasionally had to deal with
treason suspects who could protest they owed no allegiance to the
country they were accused of betraying. Accused traitors of German
origin could make this claim. Minorities in the Soviet Union such as the
Cossacks and Ukrainians could make this claim, as did ethnic Bulgarians
in Greece, Croatians in Yugoslavia, the Flemish in Belgium, and many
others. Britain’s most famous wartime traitor, the radio broadcaster for
the Nazis, William Joyce, pleaded that he may have been Irish or
American but was never a British citizen, and thus owed no loyalty to
the King. It did not save him from the gallows.

However, in India and Burma, the returning British did not face the
pleas of a few marginal figures, or minority group traitors who could do
little to threaten the state. It faced powerful and growing nationalist
sentiment at the same time as its control over territories had weakened
to the point of breaking. In India and Burma, the British attempted to
limit trials of collaborators only to those who were both traitors and
guilty of other violent crimes. In both cases, they failed to achieve
the political aims of the process as well as any meaningful reckoning
with wartime atrocities.

In India the vast reduction in the number of cases considered did not
prevent early postwar trials from becoming a powerful nationalist issue
to rally behind. In Burma the British learned from the lessons of India.
It abandoned virtually all attempts to try military collaborators guilty
of atrocities but offered nothing in its place to address the bitterness
of wartime violence that often bore a complex ethnic character. The
attempt to link treason to brutality in India, Burma, and throughout the
British empire offered no model as an alternative means to punish
wartime atrocities by Japan’s allies. In India, the British produced no
convictions of INA suspects who were guilty of the crimes against
civilians that could serve as helpful precedents in cases elsewhere in
Southeast Asia. Instead, with the exception of some violence against
Indian POWs that had not joined the INA, their crimes were usually
carried out in the name of internal military discipline and, in some
cases, would not even have constituted offenses if they had been carried
out under British orders. In Burma, where the British had evidence of
atrocities by the former Burma Independence Army, including their leader
Aung San, the decision to save the latter crippled any efforts to
continue with prosecutions. Even had this case not imploded the effort,
from the start the entire approach to the process was marred by a fatal
distortion: by using the issue of atrocities as a means to legitimize
limited retribution against those who were disloyal, the search became
one for traitors who were also incidentally guilty of atrocities, with
all the domestic political ramifications such an effort bore, rather
than as a more general independent process which aimed to find war
criminals as such.

While debates over the policies towards collaborators continued, war
crimes trials for Japanese soldiers were being carried out in over half
a dozen locations in the empire: British judges convicted over nine
hundred Japanese in over three hundred war crimes trials throughout
Southeast Asia, including 40 trials in Burma.[^^[75]^^](#_ftn75) These
trials were by no means without their flaws, and, as Utsumi Aiko has
argued, the treatment of Taiwanese and Koreans on the same level with
Japanese soldiers in war crimes trials elsewhere showed that the
universal nature of the crime did not always sit comfortably with the
contextual circumstances of the perpetrator.[^^[76]^^](#_ftn76) This
problem and the scale of the trials would have been considerably
amplified if they had included all military collaborators and informers
of the Japanese in occupied areas. However, whatever the challenges any
alternative might have faced, the choices made in these British imperial
cases tied illegitimate violence in each area to the expediency of
politics in an imperial endgame.

\

**Chapter 2: Indian Renegades from Patients to Prisoners, 1943-1946**

In late 1945 and early 1946 seven men were court-martialed in Delhi and
charged with “waging war against the King.”[^^[77]^^](#_ftn77) They had
betrayed the Indian Army they once served to fight in a Japanese
offensive that cost the Allies tens of thousands of lives on the
battlefields of western Burma and within the borders of India itself.
These officers were the unlucky few, chosen from a much larger list of
members of the Indian National Army (INA) that had violated their sworn
allegiance to the British Empire. To supporters of the trials, their
conviction was crucial, as only then, “the principle that treason cannot
be condoned will have been vindicated.”[^^[78]^^](#_ftn78)

For Indians following the progress of the trials around the country,
these men were convicted for having chosen the cause of Indian
independence over their military oath. The men charged were defended in
court by the leading legal minds of the Indian Congress party and the
Muslim League. Behind them stood the entire nationalist press of the
colony. Their trials gave birth to a new class of heroes, helped spark a
dangerous naval mutiny, and on more than one occasion were a primary
cause of riots that resulted in dozens of deaths. Though the
prosecutions all reached guilty verdicts, they were an embarrassing
failure for the colonial administration. None of those convicted would
remain in prison after India and Pakistan gained independence the
following year. And yet, these particular men were chosen because, in
addition to their treason, they could also be charged with murder,
abetment to murder, and the beating of one of their own number. What
began as treason trials, ended as trials of men charged with acts of
illegitimate violence.

The story of the formation and exploits of the Indian National Army has
been told many times.[^^[79]^^](#_ftn79) The first three prosecutions in
the Red Fort trials, as the trials of the INA came to be known, have
been carefully studied and the various courtroom arguments
analyzed.[^^[80]^^](#_ftn80) Equally well studied is the role of these
trials in instigating unrest in Calcutta and elsewhere, and especially
their impact on the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy in February,
1946.[^^[81]^^](#_ftn81) However, the soldiers and civilians in the
Indian National Army were only the most famous representatives of a
broader category of “Indian renegades.” Numbering in the thousands and
found across the world, these troublesome subjects plied their
rebellious trade abroad and many of them fought or labored for the
empire’s Axis enemies. They were also sometimes involved in acts of
brutality that went far beyond any crime that could be attributed to the
INA on the battlefields of Burma.

This chapter argues that the approach taken by the British Empire
towards the Indian National Army after Japanese surrender was key to the
fate of almost all “Indian renegades” after the war. Before they were
prisoners, most captured INA were treated as patients. When the
treachery of Britain’s colonial subjects most threatened the empire’s
wartime efforts, these men were treated as casualties affected by a
temporary affliction. They could be restored to health with rest and an
injection of patriotism. Only as Japanese defeat loomed was this lenient
approach reversed and mass trials for treason proposed. When the number
of those slated for trial were ultimately reduced to a small number of
individuals also accused of wartime atrocities, it was still the charge
of treason which hung over the entire proceedings. As the following
chapter continues the argument, these developments in British Indian
policy would also have an impact on other early postwar trials across
British Asia.

This dissertation opens with the story of British policy towards its
“Indian renegades” because, despite some of its unique characteristics,
it offers examples of all of the patterns that will become familiar in
postwar retribution in other sites considered: 1) a separation of
military collaborators from other accused traitors 2) a large scale
attempt to reform military collaborators accused of treason 3) an
ambitious plan to try wartime collaborators for treason that has its
scope rapidly narrowed in the face of insurmountable political
challenges 4) and a troubled attempt to prosecute crimes of brutality
through the laws of treason at the same time Japanese soldiers are being
tried for very similar crimes under an entirely different legal regime.

The trials of the Indian National Army deserve to be remembered, as they
are, as a moment of failure for the British empire and a signal of its
decline. However, the accusations of treason in a colonial setting that
appear so unjust to us today were not contested by British imperial
officials of the time as inappropriate. If there was internal opposition
to the prosecution of Indian independence activists who joined Britain’s
wartime enemies, it was almost always a question of prudence. The crimes
of violence that some INA officers were accused of, and other Indians
who worked with the Japanese empire were guilty of are now easier for us
to consider in isolation from the tense politics of decolonization of
the time. At the time, however, accusations of murder and torture
prosecuted in the small number of British trials of Indians after the
war were not of the sort to elicit any significant indignation of the
people of India. As we shall see, they rarely bore resemblance to the
horror or scale of atrocities being reported from the various fronts of
the war. Instead, the confused progress of the most high profile cases
set an exceedingly poor example for officials to follow elsewhere in the
British Empire.

*The Indian National Army and Foreign Volunteers in World War I**I*

In 1944, when the initiative in the war had already seemed to shift
decisively to the Allies, a newly reorganized Japanese Burma Area Army
launched a final and ultimately disastrous attempt to extend its control
into India and cut off Allied supplies: the Imphal campaign. It was a
daring and desperate military offensive which ignored the complete
inability of the Imperial Army to provide sufficient logistical or air
support. Over 220,000 Japanese troops were involved in its two component
advances in Arakan and across the frontier into India. With them, the
Japanese command reluctantly deployed around 10,000 troops of an Indian
National Army (INA) that took arms against colonial rule as well as
against tens of thousands of “loyal” Indians fighting under the British
imperial flag.[^^[82]^^](#_ftn82)

Deployed in flank guard positions, in quiet support sectors, and for use
in small-scale raids, to many Japanese commanders INA participation in
the military campaign was a sideshow. The frontline troops were a ragtag
collection of mostly British trained soldiers who could not move with
the speed or fight with the effectiveness of the Japanese. Some INA
units fought reasonably well, but it was hard to expect much from
soldiers who had very little equipment, limited logistics, and poor
field leadership.[^^[83]^^](#_ftn83) The INA was, as a 1946 British
military analysis of its wartime role put it, “David against Goliath but
a David without a sling. It had enthusiasm and revolutionary ardour, but
[lacked] most of the other military requisites.”[^^[84]^^](#_ftn84)

The Japanese had somewhat more faith in the potential political and
propaganda value of their Indian army. The charismatic leader of the
INA, Subhas Chandra Bose, had promised mass desertions of Indians from
the British lines in Burma and an Indian uprising as the army of his
Provisional Government of Free India marched, “On to Delhi.” Neither
materialized.[^^[85]^^](#_ftn85) Already by the summer of 1944 INA
soldiers were “dying like flies” due to starvation, and as the long
Japanese retreat in Burma accelerated towards the end of the year and
widespread disease compounded the lack of food and supplies, hundreds of
Indian desertions began to flow in the other
direction.[^^[86]^^](#_ftn86) Given the circumstances, however, it was
remarkable the army held together at all. As Shah Nawaz Khan, one of the
first three INA officers to face trial following the war, pointed out in
his written statement to the court, “no mercenary, or puppet army could
have faced the hardships as the INA did.”[^^[87]^^](#_ftn87) Most other
local military collaborators of the Japanese empire would likely have
long since completely dissolved under similar conditions as they would
in the Philippines and throughout occupied China, or else rebelled
against their Japanese sponsors, as did the Burma National Army.

The flagging loyalties of the INA did spread alarm among its leaders. In
the first half of March, 1945 there was, according to British sources, a
mass surrender of elements of the 4th Guerrilla Regiment, known as the
Nehru Brigade, and the more troubling desertion of several key officers
of the 2nd Division.[^^[88]^^](#_ftn88) Already faced with the deep
distrust of Japanese officers, Subhas Chandra Bose was so disturbed by
the desertions that on March 13 he issued two special orders of the day
addressing the “cowardice and treachery” of those who had marred the
reputation of the INA. He called for the writing of poems, articles, and
the performance of plays expressing “hatred and disgust” for the
deserters. He called for the creation of effigies of the traitors so
that everyone could then vent their anger against
them.[^^[89]^^](#_ftn89) After giving those no longer willing to fight
for the cause of Indian independence a week-long grace period to leave
the service, he announced new measures to “destroy completely the germs”
of cowardice by granting any INA soldier the right to arrest or shoot on
the spot anyone behaving in a “treacherous” manner. “There is no crime
more heinous and despicable,” he concluded, “than to be a coward or a
traitor.”[^^[90]^^](#_ftn90) The words could just as well have been
spoken by British colonial officials in reference to the entire INA.

However limited its value was in combat or in securing mass desertions
from the Indian Army, to thousands of Indians across the subcontinent,
the Indian National Army became the stuff of legend: the only Indian
army of men—and women, since the INA included a small unit of women
soldiers—who had taken up the sword against the Raj since the rebellion
of 1857. The parallels were apparent from beginning to end. In September
1943 Bose had held a ceremonial parade of the INA on the tomb of last
Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar who died an exile in Burma, while both
the treason and murder trials of Bahadur in 1858 and the opening trial
of INA officers for similar crimes were held in Delhi’s ancient Red
Fort.[^^[91]^^](#_ftn91) The Indian National Army was not, however, an
ordinary military force: it first took shape in Singapore as an army of
Prisoners of War in February 1942.[^^[92]^^](#_ftn92) After an early
version of the INA under the command of Mohan Singh failed to live up to
Japanese expectations, the army was renewed in July, 1943 following the
arrival on the scene of the far more influential and effective leader,
Subhas Chandra Bose.

Histories of the Indian National Army usually begin either with the
political career of Subhas Chandra Bose, or with the details of exploits
of Indian nationalists within Japan such as Rash Behari Bose. These
histories converge upon Singapore, either in 1942, when emphasizing the
thread of Japan-based developments, or in 1943, when emphasizing the
importance of Subhas Chandra Bose’s arrival. In both cases, the
establishment of the INA serves as a component of a larger narrative of
India’s struggle for independence. These histories help place the INA in
the context of the history of Indian nationalism, and serve well to
highlight some of the movement’s unique features. However, they can also
obscure the role of the INA as one of many armies founded, equipped, and
closely supervised by a sponsoring state during the Second World War.

The formation of military units composed of foreign volunteers recruited
abroad or conscripts raised from an occupied territory was common on
both sides during the conflict.[^^[93]^^](#_ftn93) As was the case in
World War I, the most important of these took the form of colonial
levies. The British, French, Dutch, and Japanese all fielded forces from
their colonies, the largest and strongest being the very Indian Army
that many of the INA soldiers had betrayed. Every major campaign in the
European conflict also included at least some of forces of non-colonial
origin. Germany, in particular, recruited a wide range of nationalities
on an impressively large scale. In many cases, however, foreign
volunteers fighting for Germany were motivated by a fear of Soviet
occupation or a positive identification with the new racial order
promised by National Socialism. Thousands of others, including several
thousand Indians, were actively recruited directly from POW camps in
violation of the 1929 third Geneva convention.[^^[94]^^](#_ftn94) In
addition to a Free Indian Legion founded by the future INA leader Subhas
Chandra Bose, thousands of Armenian, Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Kazakh, and
Turkmen POWs from the Soviet Union fought effectively against the Allies
in Italy as the 162nd Infantry Division.[^^[95]^^](#_ftn95) A full
cavalry division of pro-German Cossacks, composed in large part of POWs,
waged a campaign of brutal anti-partisan warfare.[^^[96]^^](#_ftn96)
Tens of thousands of Georgian and other Soviet POW-recruited battalions
were attached to existing German Divisions, and a small number of
“German-Arab” forces, recruited from among the surrendered colonial
armies of Britain and France served in the Caucasus, Italy, Greece, and
North Africa.[^^[97]^^](#_ftn97) The largest army of POWs in Europe
were, however, the two divisions of a “Russian Liberation Army” under
the command of the captured Soviet general Andrei Vlasov that fought
briefly for Germany in the last days of its retreat, only to face mass
execution in the aftermath of war at Soviet hands.[^^[98]^^](#_ftn98)

Despite complementing its rapidly depleting manpower, none of these
hastily assembled forces contributed significantly to the German war
effort and their value was, as would be the case for the Indian National
Army, primarily political. Among Japan’s POWs the only direct
counterpart to the INA, as we shall see in Chapter Four, was the
Philippine Bureau of Constabulary, also formed in 1942. Other attempts
to equip and sponsor local military forces took advantage of existing
local military forces or freshly trained recruits. Among Japan’s
enemies, the closest other equivalents in East Asia were Korean and
Japanese POWs recruited by Chinese Communist forces.[^^[99]^^](#_ftn99)

Among all these many POW armies, as well as other military collaborators
of Japan, the Indian National Army is deservedly the most famous and
well-studied. Only the INA developed simultaneously as a military force
and as a broad-based political movement with significant support amongst
hundreds of thousands of Indian civilians across Southeast Asia as well
as in China and in Japan’s home islands. The prestige and mystery
surrounding its most charismatic leader, Subhas Chandra Bose, and the
brief but significant postwar role it played in the final chapter of
British rule in India ensured that an army with virtually no military
significance earned an enduring place in historical memory.

*British Leniency for Captured INA*

The early response of the British Army to the existence of treasonous
Indian subjects collaborating with the Japanese was marked, with a few
exceptions in the field, by understanding and lenience. An evolving
process of classification was established, but one in which the vast
majority of those who were classified were slated for quick release,
reform in “holiday camps” or dismissal from the British Army. In this
early stage, the INA were primarily seen as mislead and demoralized
soldiers who required treatment and restoration. Only a few were seen as
beyond reform, and most were seen as worthy of the trust required to
redeploy them in the war against Japan. They were traitors, perhaps, but
their conduct was not regarded with the severity it would later take on,
or become associated strongly with atrocities or abuse of prisoners.

In the early postwar period, and in many works since, the INA was
remembered primarily as an army of surrendered soldiers. In fact,
perhaps only around half of the 40,000 or so members of Indian National
Army at its peak were former POWs. The remainder were recruits from
among Indian civilians, predominantly in Japanese occupied
Malaya.[^^[100]^^](#_ftn100) According to at least one Japanese officer
who fought with them, these civilian recruits, mostly Tamils, fought as
well if not more effectively than their putatively better trained
counterparts from the ranks of the Indian Army.[^^[101]^^](#_ftn101)
From the beginning British policy towards the handling of captured INA
soldiers recognized the distinction between the two groups and treated
them differently throughout the process. At Japanese surrender, only
“civilian” INA members who were domiciled in India were to be evacuated
there.[^^[102]^^](#_ftn102) Ultimately, at least some among these INA
soldiers and laborers, who had never set foot on the Indian
subcontinent, were “returned” to India to await potential punishment as
traitors.[^^[103]^^](#_ftn103)

Beyond the division into “civilian” and “military” (former POW) members
of the Indian National Army, British categorization of the INA entered
the psychological domain. This process of classification had already
begun under the Japanese. Indian POWs targeted by the Japanese for
recruitment into the INA were subject to schemes of classification that
began with an evaluation of their loyalties. Official Japanese military
policy was that Indian POWs were to be divided into three classes: 1)
Those who were anti-British, pro-independence, and fit to fight. These
were to be actively recruited as soldiers for the INA. 2) Sympathetic
Indians who were not fit to fight. These were recruited into labor
units. 3) Those who were considered anti-Japanese and pro-British. These
were to be accorded regular status as prisoners of war but were, at
least according to official policy, to be “treated much better than”
white prisoners.[^^[104]^^](#_ftn104) The thousands of Indian POWs who
made their way into the first category came with a range of motives,
which included, for many, a genuine belief that the INA offered an
opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the liberation of India from
British rule.[^^[105]^^](#_ftn105)

However, coercion could also play an important role. In the early stages
of recruiting in 1942 many of those who were unwilling to join the INA
were subject to harsh beatings and torture, while the rest faced the
prospect of even more backbreaking labor and the high fatality rates in
Japanese POW camps.[^^[106]^^](#_ftn106) Despite reports of coercion,
some of those who did join the INA denied that there was any unfair
treatment meted out to those unwilling to fight for the Japanese. Prem
K. Sahgal insisted in his statement at his postwar treason trial that
non-volunteers in the camp he occupied at Tengab Aerodrome received
adequate rations and were not pressured to join the
INA.[^^[107]^^](#_ftn107) As we shall see, the fate of Indians who
remained loyal to the Allies weighed heavily in the minds of the British
military most in the later stages of the debate over how to deal with
the INA. With a few exceptions, from 1943 to the spring of 1945 the
problem of the JIFs (Japan’s Indian Fifth-columnists), as those such as
the INA and others suspected of collaborating with the Japanese were
called, was handled almost entirely as if the Indian Army faced not a
judicial challenge, but a curable medical problem.

The British military interrogated recovered POWs, suspect refugees, and
stragglers to expose spies and INA members.[^^[108]^^](#_ftn108) Prior
to 1944, when there were limited opportunities to capture significant
numbers of the weaker early incarnation of the INA, the total number of
suspected collaborators with Japan who had been arrested was still not
trivial. An incomplete collection of three May, 1943 rosters of suspects
arrested under Defense of India Rules by the Forward Interrogation Camp
at Chittagong, including, but not limited to INA suspects, lists 156
names, but the serial numbers suggest 352 prisoners, all of whom were
arrested in the span of a few months in the spring of
1943.[^^[109]^^](#_ftn109) The specific allegations are not listed, and
though close to the front, those listed could have been detained for a
number of specific politically subversive crimes, of which “waging war
against the King” was only one. The list was also not limited to Indian
subjects; containing some recognizably Burmese and Chinese names and
labeled as having been apprehended in Burmese districts. Only 41 were
sent to civilian jails and the fate of the other prisoners is not clear.

Those who emerged from enemy occupied territory who did not qualify for
“quick release” were detained and any suspected deserters or known INA
were eligible for an immediate Court of Inquiry. These Courts of Inquiry
posed the most serious threat to the lives of INA solders who were
captured since their fate could be determined in the field, where the
process was subjected to little public scrutiny. It was only in the
small number of these courts-martial that, in addition to INA special
service infiltrators caught spying within India, a small number of INA
soldiers captured on the front were court-martialed and executed for the
crime of “waging war against the King” from 1944 to early 1945, well
before the famous postwar trials at the Red Fort in
Delhi.[^^[110]^^](#_ftn110) Though military proceedings against
desertion and other infractions were being carried out in the thousands
throughout the world, initial orders that allowed British officers to
hold Courts of Inquiry of INA soldiers were later changed to limit them
only to those cases cleared beforehand by General
Headquarters.[^^[111]^^](#_ftn111)

In this earlier period, the British response was guided less by a desire
to eradicate treason than to prevent any impact on the morale of other
British and Indian soldiers in the field. This contrasts significantly
with later internal criticism of early postwar trials that was primarily
concerned with the impact upon nationalist sentiment throughout the
Indian subcontinent. The 1944 decision to limit Courts of Inquiry
specifically noted the need to reduce the possibility that suspects or
their trials might become known to the troops. Rather than concern about
sympathy for troops being tried, it was seen as important that the
continued existence of other treacherous persons still in occupied
territory might be kept secret.[^^[112]^^](#_ftn112)

 With the exception of those subjected to the small number of Courts of
Inquiry, recovered POWs and known INA personnel were to be sorted once
again. After being sent to forward interrogation centers, suspects were
all to be divided into three categories based on their perceived loyalty
and morale: Whites, Grays, and Blacks*.[^**^[113]^**^](#_ftn113)* This
color coding process is described in all historical accounts of the fate
of the INA, but it is rarely pointed out that the definition of these
categories and the treatment of each category evolved over time. In
fact, the color-coding practice may have only gradually become
instituted during the course of 1943. Among the several hundred spring
1943 arrestees at the forward interrogation camp at Chittagong mentioned
above, for example, only a small minority of the prisoners were assigned
a color, with some 11 prisoners categorized “Gray” and 12
“Black.”[^^[114]^^](#_ftn114)

The “White” category was used for INA personnel whose loyalty and morale
were unaffected by their exposure to enemy propaganda during their
period of time serving the Japanese military, or at least were found to
be “no longer” affected.[^^[115]^^](#_ftn115) They were variously
described as having joined the INA to avoid hardship or else merely
following the orders of their immediate superiors. Whites could be sent
directly to regimental centers or military depots following
interrogation and from there were sent on leave. Upon return to service
following leave, the behavior and morale of Whites were to be
“discretely observed” for three months. In mid-1944 this policy was
changed to allow Whites to be quickly re-assigned to combats units
without leave, both because of their value as battle-hardened soldiers
and because, “Whites were eager to return and have another crack at the
Japanese.”[^^[116]^^](#_ftn116)

Military Grays were individuals whose loyalty and morale were
“temporarily affected” by Japanese influence, but were soldiers who were
not considered, “fundamentally disloyal.”[^^[117]^^](#_ftn117) Elsewhere
they were described as men who had been misled but were not active
leaders within the INA.[^^[118]^^](#_ftn118) As early as December 1942,
the policy for handling these men of dubious loyalty was to dispatch
them to a camp organized “in the guise of a Holiday Rest Camp” in the
scenic Himalayan Shimla hills at Sabathu and later in Multan for
“reconditioning.”[^^[119]^^](#_ftn119) While at the camp, military Grays
were to receive complete rest, good food, adequate amenities, radio,
cinema, lectures, facilities for sport, and military parades sufficient
to “restore gradually martial spirit and beaming.”[^^[120]^^](#_ftn120)

Grays were thus treated not as suspected traitors, but as men afflicted
by a contagious medical condition. In this respect these soldiers were
not alone in Sabathu, as the small town had, since 1837, also been the
site of a large Leper Asylum.[^^[121]^^](#_ftn121) Some 1,500 Gray
“patients,” as they were self-consciously referred to, had passed
through the camp by the end of 1944 and, with the exception of negative
reports in two cases, emerged fully “recovered” following the five to
eight weeks of treatment. Recovered Grays were then reclassified as
Whites and either returned to their regiments or sent on leave. Unlike
Whites, however, recovered Grays who were returned to service were
generally not sent to an operational or active combat
districts.[^^[122]^^](#_ftn122)

This approach to disloyalty taken by the British military authorities
was, up until this point, mostly an effort to reverse the circumstances
of INA recruits in the POW camps who faced a choice between hardship and
heavy labor or treason and possible death in battle. The struggle to
“recover” the loyalty of these men was primarily seen as a struggle to
overcome the mental hold of enemy propaganda. A similar process was
employed by the Japanese who provided “rejuvenation” training for
captured Philippine soldiers in 1942. This intensive re-education
process was designed to cure the soldiers of their enslavement to
American ideology.[^^[123]^^](#_ftn123) This was also not unlike the
rehabilitation Communist efforts directed at thousands of captured
Chinese “puppet” troops during and after the war considered in Chapter
Seven.

The vast majority of these treasonous troops, some 89% of all those
classified by May, 1945 were not only spared prosecution for treason but
were mostly returned to regular military service, sometimes after being
given leave or reconditioning in the “Holiday Rest
Camp.”[^^[124]^^](#_ftn124) Those who were returned to their units were
treated as normal recovered POWs without the stigma associated with
having fought for the enemy, or with any impact upon their rank or
benefits. Only their commanding officers would know of their former INA
service.[^^[125]^^](#_ftn125)

The last of the categories was Black. Until the creation of a Dark Gray
classification considered below, Blacks included “all individuals whose
morale is permanently affected and who are considered to be
fundamentally disloyal and [a] danger to security.”[^^[126]^^](#_ftn126)
Elsewhere they were described as INA personnel who were “imbued with
enemy propaganda and remain actively hostile.”[^^[127]^^](#_ftn127)
Their treason posed the greatest risk of contagion and military Blacks
were to be rapidly and secretly returned to India and denied any
communication with the outside world. Regulations for the secret
detention of military Blacks were issued in early 1944 by the Home
Department of the Government of India. However, since captured or
deserted INA forces had already begun to trickle into British hands
since January 1943, Blacks were initially sent to a variety of camps and
jails. Only in the summer of 1943 did the first group of these “special
prisoners” arrive at a central detention center for Blacks at Attock
Fort, some 90 kilometers west of Rawalpindi.[^^[128]^^](#_ftn128)

As the number of INA personnel who fell into British hands dramatically
increased in number in the spring of 1945, the soldiers seen to fit this
category exploded. When Rangoon fell in May, 8,000 military INA suspects
surrendered or were captured, more than tripling the number of those who
had passed through British hands up to this point. There were now simply
too many to accommodate in any “Holiday Rest Camp.”[^^[129]^^](#_ftn129)
Initially, this resulted in a further easing of the policy. Grays were
directly returned to regimental centers and issued certificates of leave
that designated them, “recovered P.W. classified ‘Grey’ but to be
treated as ‘White.’”[^^[130]^^](#_ftn130) Some of these Grays, however,
were seen as more in need of “treatment” than others, and the new policy
spawned yet another category, “Dark Gray.” Dark Grays, who up to the
fall of Rangoon only numbered 126 INA and members of the German Indian
Legion, were seen as requiring a much longer period of reconditioning
before they were fit to return to service, or else were discharged from
the Army should the Holiday Rest Camp fail to reform
them.[^^[131]^^](#_ftn131) Indian Legion soldiers back from Europe,
known as HIFs or “Hitler’s Indian Fifth-columnists,” were especially
suspect as, “on the whole more hardened traitors” who had been “deeply
impressed by German methods, efficiency, equipment and
ruthlessness.”[^^[132]^^](#_ftn132) As we shall see in Chapter Three,
this reputation may have been due in part to the conduct of some of the
Legion’s members in France during the final days of the European war.

With the introduction of the new Dark Gray classification and the flow
of thousands of new INA personnel into British custody in 1945, the
Black category also narrowed accordingly, in order to exclude any and
all personnel for whom there remained the possibility of a “favorable”
reaction to rehabilitation. It was now only to include civilian or
military subjects who, judged immune to reform, constituted a serious
and permanent threat to security, or a military subject who it was
considered should be brought to trial for a criminal
offense.[^^[133]^^](#_ftn133) The classification system now contemplated
not only the psychological dimension, that is, the consideration of
loyalty and thus any potential future betrayal, but the more concrete
possibility of eventual prosecution, though there was still no direct
discussion of what specific criminal offenses Blacks would be prosecuted
for beyond the treason Courts of Inquiry could have tried them for in
the field.

*The Hardening of British Policy Towards the INA*

Histories that discuss the fate of the INA have rarely considered the
leniency of British policy during the war and focus exclusively on the
small number of postwar trials.[^^[134]^^](#_ftn134) They thus do not
need to recognize the fact that this policy changed quite suddenly as
the conclusion of the war neared. Exactly why this took place is a
mystery that this dissertation is not able not resolve decisively. It
might be argued that the policy changed because what was not possible
before had become possible: during the war troops were needed for
redeployment, and any potential risk to morale by mass punishment too
great. This explanation is unconvincing, however, since the conclusion
of the war brought even greater instability to the Indian subcontinent,
not less. Wartime controls against subversive acts lost their
justification with peace, and deferred calls for devolution of power
would have to be answered by a substantially weakened empire. British
colonial and cabinet officials did suggest that releasing INA soldiers
would reward their disloyalty and compound this instability in the
postwar period, but this new justification was not raised in documents
from the military forces that were carrying out the categorization
process in the forward interrogation centers themselves.

Another explanation, which we will consider below in greater detail,
lies with an increase in a desire for vengeance. Was the hardening of
the policy due to a growing anger at the brutality of Indian
collaborators with the Japanese toward Allied prisoners, a recognition
of a hatred among soldiers who suffered heavy losses on the Burmese
front, or Indian prisoners who contrasted their own suffering with the
presumed benefits of the INA alternative? This accords with
justifications produced at the time, but in materials I have found, the
evidence for the breadth of these sentiments come from vague and
indirect references by colonial officials, with only a few direct
contemporary reports and later memoirs suggesting its severity.

Between May and August 1945 the policy which focused on the release,
redeployment, or treatment of treasonous “patients” to one which
assigned more and more INA soldiers into the category of Blacks. This
category was also increasingly described in terms of the eligibility of
its members for future prosecution. This shift coincided with a separate
re-categorization of all potentially threatening “Security Prisoners”
carried out throughout India that usually had the opposite outcome.
Thousands of cases of were being reviewed to determine their potential
qualification for release at end of the war. These cases included such
diverse individuals as detained Congress party politicians, Japanese
agents and convicted terrorists. All Japanese and other enemy agents
were to be released automatically at the close of the conflict, while
others subject to preventive detention would become eligible for
release.[^^[135]^^](#_ftn135) While there was an unmistakable trend
towards an easing of security measures and detention policies
domestically, INA policy was moving in the opposite direction.

A weekly security intelligence summary in June, 1945 included a summary
of an interrogation of one of the commanders of the four INA guerrilla
regiments, warning of future threats. The commander expressed the view
that any captured INA soldiers returned to their units would play the
part of “good and well-disciplined soldiers on parade” but that off duty
they would talk about their experiences in the INA and, as a result,
nationalism would infect the entire Indian Army.[^^[136]^^](#_ftn136)
The same report claimed that loyal soldiers of one unit in Rangoon
“would not hesitate to shoot” INA soldiers as traitors, and that Indian
officers in the same unit felt that INA members should only be allowed
to return to India if cleared of guilt in a
court-martial.[^^[137]^^](#_ftn137)

In a June letter by Philip Mason, the Joint Secretary to the War
Department (India) who would become one of the key individuals in the
formation of policy towards the INA, proposed three possibilities for
handling the large numbers of INA soldiers coming into British hands: 1)
they could be court-martialed whenever evidence was available but this
would lead to a “considerable number of death sentences,” 2) a limited
number could be allowed to stand for court-martial, with most sentences
remitted or 3) all offenders could be treated lightly. Of these, the War
Department favored the second option, “by which all Blacks against whom
there is sufficient evidence would be brought to trial, and sentenced in
accordance with the law,” though only severe cases would result in
execution. At this point, the disloyalty of the INA soldiers was the
primary consideration–there was no mention in the letter of the
accusations of atrocities that would become central in the eventual
trials. Mason noted that the lenient treatment accorded to the INA
already amounted to a “whitewash” and that any limiting the scope of
trials would allow “traitors” to go “virtually without
punishment.”[^^[138]^^](#_ftn138)

The emergence of a more concrete discussion about prosecutions for INA
Blacks was important but the hardening of British policy also extended
to a reevaluation of the treatment of Grays. Solders who had until
recently been returned to their units and treated as Whites without any
stigma attached were now considered for harsher treatment. In a 6 August
meeting between Indian Governor-General Archibald Wavell, Indian Army
Commander-in-Chief Sir Claude Auchinleck, and Home and Finance members,
everyone agreed that Grays should be discharged from the Indian Army,
with the main point of disagreement being over whether they were to
receive back pay for their time as prisoners of war. In his diary entry
on the meeting, Governor-General Wavell recorded his strong opposition
to the offering of back pay for traitorous soldiers, “I really could not
stand for our paying men to fight against us.”[^^[139]^^](#_ftn139)

Meanwhile, the number of Blacks as a percentage of the total INA
surrendered or captured significantly increased by Japan’s surrender.
Among those captured before the fall of Rangoon in early May 1945,
Blacks and Dark Grays numbered only 383 out of 3,513 (About 11%) INA and
Indian Legion in custody.[^^[140]^^](#_ftn140) By 11 August, when a real
debate over the scope of prosecutions began, the total of Blacks were
estimated at 7,600, out of around 16,000 recovered INA and a few
thousand members of the Indian Legion (47%, but likely around 30% if the
Indian Legion is excluded).[^^[141]^^](#_ftn141) For an estimated 5,600
of these Blacks, it was felt there would be insufficient evidence to
merit court-martial some kind. For another 1,400, it was believed there
was evidence to convict but that there would be “practical difficulties”
in carrying out the court-martial. Trials were proposed for some 600
Blacks.[^^[142]^^](#_ftn142)

The rapid increase in proportion of Blacks and the high number of
proposed trials at this particular moment is puzzling. Those captured
before the fall of Rangoon would likely have included most of the troops
who, chosen by Subhas Chandra Bose for their martial ability and
loyalty, were among the mere quarter or so of the INA forces who were
actually deployed in the combat areas of western Burma at various points
in 1944. It is reasonable to expect that forward-based forces comprised
the most dedicated opponents to British rule as well as those who were
likely to have had the opportunity to capture or kill Allied personnel
in combat. On the other hand, with the exception of leading staff
officers under Bose, it is hard to see how the thousands of INA
personnel who surrendered around Rangoon, or the thousands of mostly
“civilian”—that is those who were not Indian Army POWs—personnel of the
3rd INA division stationed in Malaya could include so many Black
“hardened traitors.” These forces surrendered, for the most part,
without a shot at Japan’s surrender in August, 1945. On the contrary,
many of these Malayan Indians would not even be eligible for
transportation to India in the first place. Whatever the logic behind
the classification, these greatly enlarged numbers anchored the opening
of an August, 1945 dialogue between officials over the establishment of
a public policy on the trial of INA crimes. A debate began as a simple
case of how to confront large-scale betrayal. Very soon, however, a
process of peeling away categories of trial candidates began that would
ultimately transform treason trials into trials for treasonous
atrocities.

*Justifying Prosecutions of the INA*

Over the summer of 1945 leading up to Japanese surrender, the British
Army produced an alarming number of INA Blacks for potential trial,
reversing its earlier policy of leniency. Only at this late point was
there any significant discussion of exactly what crime these men would
be charged with, what sentences could be expected, and what the impact
of the process might be. Only gradually would the discussion shift from
one which focused upon the direct security threat posed by the INA to
one which highlighted the supposed political consequences of tolerating
disloyalty, and finally into a cause of justice which emphasized the
brutality and violence of some INA soldiers.

For some, the issue remained a simple question of security. The prospect
of 600 estimated court-martials of INA soldiers as put forward by the
Home and War departments of the Government of India and Burma on 11
August was immediately questioned by the Secretary of State for India
and Burma, Frederick Pethick-Lawrence. Pethick-Lawrence was alarmed at
the significant number of the court-martials estimated as well as the
prospect of continued detention of thousands of INA personnel.

“Does not the fact of surrender require modification of your proposals?
Is not the danger to security which you advance as grounds for detention
of the 7,000 Blacks considerably lessoned or generally altered in
character? I should be glad to know how you now regard the danger of
treating these men as Grey?”[^^[143]^^](#_ftn143)\
 \

Pethick-Lawrence posed the question from the perspective of British
wartime policy: the INA had posed a military risk that no longer existed
after Japanese surrender. Just as many security prisoners, including
some who had carried out or threatened violence against the Raj, were to
be released throughout India, what harm was there in reclassifying and
releasing the disarmed and demoralized remnants of the INA and the
Indian Legion? The response to this challenge guided the course of
debate that culminated in the handful of trials at the Red Fort in
November and into the spring of 1946.

Three general lines of argument justifying a stronger punitive response
can be made out in the letters, conference notes and announcements of
British government officials in the months to come. The security threat
posed by the INA had indeed been, as Pethick-Lawrence suggested,
“generally altered in character,” by the surrender, but according to
some of his critics, this did not make the threat they posed any less
serious. Colonial officials showed significant concern that leniency
shown towards the INA would be perceived as weakness by any potentially
disloyal elements within an Indian Army still deployed in the tens of
thousands throughout the empire and beyond.

This weakness would also be exploited by contending political forces
within India as the prospect of a political settlement loomed. As Prime
Minister Clement Attlee put it at a cabinet meeting on 17 August,
“Nothing could be worse, if we are about to establish self-government in
India, than to let the impression grow that rebellion was an easy thing
that need not be taken too seriously.”[^^[144]^^](#_ftn144) At another
cabinet meeting 25 October it was suggested that allowing soldiers who
had violated their oaths of allegiance to go unpunished, would, “readily
lend itself to action subversive of the Government.” Here however, it
was not only the British administration that was threatened, for this
potential subversion, “might have incalculable consequences for
independent Indian Governments in the future.”[^^[145]^^](#_ftn145)
Bearing the burden of trying the INA rebels and facing public backlash
against the trials was therefore portrayed not merely as a policy which
served British self-interest, but which sought to ensure the stability
of any future free India.

A related but more direct security concern went beyond the threat to
morale within the Indian Army or the showing of a weak hand to rebels in
general. Colonial officials feared that released and cashiered soldiers
who had served in the INA would soon reemerge as the trained and
experienced core of an “Army of Congress” which would rise up against
British rule, or else combine forces with existing armed rebels. At a
meeting of provincial representatives held on 14 and 15 August, “[The
governor of] Bengal in particular stated that their terrorists were
eagerly awaiting the return of these determined persons trained in the
use of arms, and methods of violence.”[^^[146]^^](#_ftn146) Only the
detention and a gradual release of those who were no longer regarded as
a threat could be countenanced. In an October letter to
Pethick-Lawrence, Governor-General Wavell passed on troubling rumors
that Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru had engaged in “subversive
conversations” in Lahore, about his, “plan to make use of the INA—large
quantities of arms are said to have been smuggled into India from the
Burma front—both to train Congress volunteers and as a Congress striking
force; and also possibly to tamper with the Indian
Army.”[^^[147]^^](#_ftn147)

Finally, there was the issue of justice or, when this justification for
trials was later played down, “abstract justice.” It was within this
discussion, which initially emerged almost as an afterthought, that the
issue of violence and brutality was raised. Injustice here included both
the sense of betrayal–framed primarily as betrayal of fellow Indian
soldiers rather than the British Empire, and injustice in the form of
illegitimate violence. Was it not a sheer insult to the bravery of the
Indian Army who served loyally in battle, the question was posed, if
those who cast off their allegiance and fought for the enemy were
allowed to go free? And what of the Indian POW who, despite the prospect
of beatings, hard labor, and starvation, resisted the call to join the
INA and remained true?

*Justice and the Loyal Indian Prisoner of War*

Justifications for harsh punishment that rested upon the inherent
injustice of clemency would eventually yield the most powerful rhetoric,
even if it was only gradually adopted. As with the claim that condoning
disloyalty in the Indian Army would threaten the security of a future
independent India, the cause of justice for the indignant POW had the
virtue of transforming the INA trials from a British Imperial cause into
an Indian one. As seen above, reports of anger and bitterness towards
the INA were included in intelligence briefings at least by June, 1945
but it appears to have been discussed as justification for legal action
only somewhat later. In October Wavell predicted that Congress attempts
to take up the defense of the INA cause would backfire when India’s
soldiers returned home.

I saw two battalions of Gurkhas at Dehra Dun, who have returned from
Prisoners of War camps in Malaya. They were far more bitter about the
INA than about the Japs, and said that the worst of their ill-treatment
came from the former. Their one request to me was to see that stern
justice was dealt out to the INA. The Commander-in-Chief tells me that
this feeling is universal among the returned POW…[^^[148]^^](#_ftn148)

At a National Defense Council meeting held over the course of the
following three days, an Indian officer who had survived the prisoner of
war camps was invited to speak about his experiences. His statement
focused mostly upon the INA and offered a “moving account of the
sufferings the prisoners of war had undergone at the hands of their own
countrymen.” The officer claimed that, upon their return, the loyal
survivors were “shocked” to find that the INA were “acclaimed as the
national heroes” while the POWs were neglected.[^^[149]^^](#_ftn149)

The cause of the loyal POW soon made it into the planning reports on the
upcoming trials. When an estimate was produced, as we shall see below,
that 50 death sentences would be confirmed for court-martialed INA
Blacks, the otherwise matter-of-fact style of the report justified the
death sentences in emotive terms that would soon become widespread, “To
deal leniently with such cases would cause great offense to the Indian
Army and in particular to those POWs who remained steadfastly loyal in
spite of all blandishments, propaganda, hardship and brutality to which
they were subject.”[^^[150]^^](#_ftn150)

The loyal POW did not only appeal his cause to the British government,
however. Captain Hari Badhwar, a returned POW from the 3rd Cavalry who
had surrendered in Singapore, reported on the “true story of the INA”
and their “brutal treatment” of fellow POWs directly to the lawyer and
Congress legislator Asaf Ali.[^^[151]^^](#_ftn151) Ali, who later served
as India’s first ambassador to the US, was a member of the INA Defense
Committee and reportedly spoke to Badhwar for over three hours. The
conversation, as it was reported by Badhwar to Governor-General Wavell’s
secretary Evan Jenkins and then summarized in a letter by Jenkins, has
been seen as evidence for the raw political motivations behind Congress
support for the INA cause.[^^[152]^^](#_ftn152) In statements remarkable
for one of the leading lawyers organizing the INA defense, Ali allegedly
admitted to Badhwar that, if Congress had been in power, they would have
cashiered the INA from the army and put some of them on trial–but only
if the British government refrained from doing so themselves. Even
admitting the brutality of some of the INA, however, Congress could not
now withdraw its support since, “they would lose much ground in the
country.”[^^[153]^^](#_ftn153) It would not have come as a surprise to
the British administration that Congress was attempting to maximize the
political utility of the INA issue, but more revealing was the sense in
Ali’s reported responses to Badhwar, that national support for the issue
was now something Congress was trapped into acting upon. Nehru too
admitted that he found the national response to the INA cause
“astonishing” and suggested that his inability to predict the response
made him feel “out of date.”[^^[154]^^](#_ftn154)

The experience of Badhwar was not that of a typical soldier in the
Indian Army. He had attended Christ’s College, Cambridge and the
University of Grenoble in France before joining the Indian Army. His
postwar fate was also far from one of neglect. Captain Badhwar
eventually rose to the rank of Major-General.[^^[155]^^](#_ftn155)
During the war, he was the “right hand man” of “Drag” Dhargalkar.
Dhargalkar was a widely respected Indian officer, a leader among
loyalist POWs as well as a future general in post-independence
India.[^^[156]^^](#_ftn156) As leading opponents to INA recruitment in
the camps, both Dhargalkar and Badhwar were at one point separated from
the other prisoners and suspended in a specially prepared underground
cage in Bangkok for 88 days, where they suffered further degradation at
the hands of their Japanese captors.[^^[157]^^](#_ftn157) When
Dhargalkar, who was a prosecution witness at the first Red Fort trial
against the INA, attempted to describe the ordeal, his testimony was cut
short when the defense understandably protested that the incident had
nothing to do with acts committed by the INA.[^^[158]^^](#_ftn158)
Robbed of this opportunity, Dhargalkar’s could say nothing of INA acts
that affected him personally and admitted he was not even asked to
perform labor. Instead, he offered only passing mention of having
witnessed the beating of prisoners. Only once was he able to name a
perpetrator of beatings of other prisoners, Fateh Khan, and Khan was not
among those in the dock for the first trial.[^^[159]^^](#_ftn159)

Badhwar became the most prominent representative of loyal Indian POWs in
the relatively muted British propaganda efforts to justify prosecutions
of the INA. The 1 November issue of *Indian Information*, produced by
the Bureau of Public Information included a feature on Badhwar under the
title “Refused to Join the I.N.A.” Describing Badhwar’s ordeal together
with Dhargalkar in Bangkok it concluded that “only a man of exceptional
courage and physique” could have resisted the temptation to give in to
the temptation to betray the Indian Army and join the INA. After he was
returned to the camp, he showed an almost stereotypical English stoicism
when he was reported to have told an inquiring old friend merely that he
had, “rather a rough time.”[^^[160]^^](#_ftn160) The article made very
little attempt to link the Badhwar case more strongly to the upcoming
INA trials, however, and not much appears to have been done to mount a
strong defense of the trials in the name of figures such as him.
Governor-General Wavell records in his journal that, when he met with
the acting-editor of the *Times of India*, Ivor S. Jehu on the eve of
the first INA trial on 3 November, Jehu warned the Governor that, “Our
propaganda and publicity over the I.N.A. was fatally slow and
ineffective…we have given Congress a weapon which they have been not
slow to use, and very unscrupulously.”[^^[161]^^](#_ftn161) Though it
was not sufficient to diminish widespread sympathy for the accused, the
emphasis on the wartime plight of the loyal Indian POW did have the
double virtue of both justifying the release of the vast proportion of
the INA members who might have lacked the “exceptional courage” of
Badhwar, while honoring those captured Indians who did stay suffer in
the camps.

There was another way the British government could achieve this: through
war crimes trials for Japanese soldiers who were primarily responsible
for the suffering of Indian POWs. The very first military war crimes
tribunal held by the British after the war dealt exclusively with
charges involving the abuse of Indian soldiers.[^^[162]^^](#_ftn162) The
accused Captain Gozawa Sadaichi and nine other Japanese soldiers were
arrested on 15 August, 1945 by U.S. Forces in Palau. They were charged
with the physical abuse and mistreatment of Indian prisoners, the
illegal beheading of an Indian prisoner in April, 1945, and for
responsibility in the death of eight other Indian prisoners as a result
of flogging or other abuse.

In his retrospective account of this war crimes trial, Colin Sleeman,
the defense lawyer for the accused Japanese soldiers, alleged that the
British Army’s decision to focus the first trial on Japanese war
criminals whose victims were Indian was anything but a coincidence. It
was, he claimed, designed to emphasize the sacrifices of Indian POWs as
the INA trials approached in India. By holding trials in which Indians
were the victims, the British Army sought to “demonstrate once more the
absolute equality before the law of the rights of all Imperial subjects,
irrespective of nationality, race or colour.”[^^[163]^^](#_ftn163) This
first British war crimes trial helped set precedents for all British
trials to follow, especially with regard to three important issues: the
responsibility of subordinate officers who had been ordered to carry out
atrocities, a ruling on the command responsibility of higher officers in
cases where they did not explicitly order the crimes, and importantly, a
confirmation that Japanese soldiers were, without Japan having ratified
it, still bound to the terms of the 1929 Geneva convention as customary
international law.[^^[164]^^](#_ftn164)

If Sleeman was right in identifying the trial’s main goal, then it
failed completely. This trial and its outcome came too late to have any
bearing on events in India. By the time the accused had been transferred
to Singapore in preparation for trial in mid-November, the INA trials
were already underway in India, with national support for the accused
well established. Nakamura Kaniyuki, the only soldier in the case
sentenced to execution, was shot in March, 1946, and the others were all
given prison sentences. By this point, the moment had long passed for
any real chance for coverage of the case in India to have any real
impact.

*Narrowing the Scope of the Trials*

In the fall of 1945, the British colonial government was faced with
varying estimates of hundreds or thousands of potential prosecutions and
a variety of potential justifications for the scale and severity of
planned proceedings against the INA. It was not enough to create a
sympathetic image of the loyal Indian POW or recognize the suffering of
these prisoners under Japanese or INA camp guards. Preparations for
actual trials, criminal investigations of the alleged atrocities, and
propaganda to attract sympathetic public had all barely begun.

In a letter to the Secretary of State for India Pethick-Lawrence on 21
August Governor-General Wavell suggested issuing a communiqué within the
week. He described in great detail the practical and political
difficulties in carrying out large numbers of proceedings, including the
need for 250 officers to sit on courts-martial for a year and process
some 2,000 case files.[^^[165]^^](#_ftn165) The governor suggested that
the government announce a “middle course” which would “punish only the
leaders” and offer others clemency. For Wavell, it was still the treason
of INA’s leaders, and the desire to make an example of the most
prominent turncoats which was foremost on his mind. Nowhere in his
detailed overview of the issue as it stood in August was there any
mention of violent crimes.

The communiqué announcing INA trial policy was drafted by War Department
secretary Philip Mason and issued the following week, on 27 August. It
did offer clemency to the rank and file, but the scope was tweaked to
emphasize violent crimes: “there remains a number–who are alleged to
have killed their former comrades or to have been responsible for the
capture or torture of Allied soldiers and some leaders, who appear to
have consciously embraced the Japanese or German
cause…”[^^[166]^^](#_ftn166) No clue was offered as to the number of INA
personnel that would eventually be tried. In fact, after the issuing of
the communiqué, little progress seemed to have been made on the actual
logistics and limitations of scope of the trials for almost two months.
Then, on October 20 only two weeks before the first trial would open, a
paper was presented to the India and Burma committee of the cabinet in
London with a new updated assessment of who would be prosecuted.

Of 2,565 INA blacks and around 3,000 Indian Legion blacks (these
“hardened traitors” were all “provisionally classified black”) those who
were to be targeted for court-martial were divided into ten categories:

A. 59 Those who had been officers in the Indian Army

B. 29 Viceroy’s commissioned officers (VCOs) who became officers in the
INA

C. 14 VCOs who joined the Indian Legion in Germany

D. 40 Deserters who joined the INA

E. 12 other ranked soldiers (IORs) who became officers in the Indian
Legion

F. 60 INA soldiers who were guilty of causing the death of a British or
Allied subject

G. 92 INA soldiers who were guilty of brutal conduct towards their
fellow INA or Indian Legion members

H. 53 INA soldiers who took part in capture or handing over of Allied
personnel to the enemy.

I. 240 IORs who became officers in the INA and who took a leading part
in the battle against the Allies

J. 205 Indian “Fujiwara Volunteers” who were the earliest to join the
Indian National Army[^^[167]^^](#_ftn167)

Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck ordered that only trials for those in
categories D and F to J go forward, while other categories be postponed.
Only two of these six categories (F and G) might be described as war
crimes, but they comprised well over half of the accused. Of these
initial cases, it was estimated that guilty sentences would be found in
60 cases of causing death, 92 cases of brutal treatment, 53 cases of
handing over Allied personnel to the enemy, and 40 VCOs (Viceroy's
Commissioned Officers, Indian officers) or IORs (Indian Other Ranks,
likely including non-commissioned officers) who deserted and joined the
INA.[^^[168]^^](#_ftn168) As a result of guilty sentences, it was
predicted that 50 death sentences would be handed down and carried out.

While these sober estimates were being updated, troubling signs of
serious opposition from Indian nationalists emerged. Nehru immediately
condemned the August communiqué.[^^[169]^^](#_ftn169) Intelligence
reports warned that most political rallies in the Central Provinces
included demands for an end to action against the
INA.[^^[170]^^](#_ftn170) In a letter to Wavell’s secretary Evan M.
Jenkins, Mahatma Gandhi wrote that, while he had “nothing in common with
any defense by force of arms,” he was not blind to the “valor and
patriotism” of armed men and that since India “adores these men” it
would be a misuse of Government power if it proceeded with trials
against them, “in the teeth of universal Indian
opposition.”[^^[171]^^](#_ftn171)

The first trials against the INA were scheduled finally for 5 November.
In the week leading up to the opening, however, Governor-General Wavell
and other colonial officials were increasingly concerned with what they
saw as, “the violent tone of the Congress politicians and the
nationalist Press.” Writing to Pethick-Lawrence on 29 October, the
Governor-General warned of “stormy weather ahead” and the potential of a
violent mass movement after the upcoming legislative
elections.[^^[172]^^](#_ftn172) By 2 November, it was already decided to
further reduce the scope of trials. While the original plan was to carry
out the trials over the course of a full year, the entire process would
now be condensed into a period of six months. Instead of postponing some
categories, courts-martial in categories A, B, C and E were to be
completely dropped, and deserters in category D dealt with without any
mention of their INA membership. Those in other categories would only be
court-martialed if they could be convicted of at least one charge other
than “waging war against the King.”[^^[173]^^](#_ftn173)
Governor-General Wavell reported that the Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck
now estimated 125 trials, 45 death sentences, and only 20 executions
actually being carried out.

Meeting with Nehru for an hour the following day, Wavell’s concerns were
only amplified. As he records their conversation, Nehru, “practically
admitted that he was preaching violence.”[^^[174]^^](#_ftn174) Faced
with increasing disorder, violent threats to colonial rule, and growing
communal violence, Wavell tied his concerns to the looming trials,

We shall before long be faced with the issue of another violent
suppression of Congress, with weaker and rather demoralised forces
perhaps, if their intimidation of officials and police continues
unchecked and they succeed in dividing the [Indian Army] over the I.N.A.
Trials; or of capitulation to them.[^^[175]^^](#_ftn175)

The Governor of Sind province, Hugh Dow, wrote to Wavell the same day,
reporting that, “agitation to stop the I.N.A. trials is clearly being
centrally directed and is becoming almost hysterical.” However, Dow
interpreted this more as a sign of desperate action, rather than
strength and speculated that the rise in agitation might actually be
connected to a fear on the part of Congress that heinous crimes might be
exposed in the trials, rather than simply treason.[^^[176]^^](#_ftn176)
The angry response to the trials would only grow much worse in the
coming weeks.

*A First-Class Blunder*

The first trial against the INA opened on 5 November, 1945 against Shah
Nawaz Khan, Prem Kumar Sahgal, and Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon. The trial of
these three well-liked officers jumped ahead of a treason and lethal
flogging case initially scheduled to go first, involving the less
sympathetic figure of one Burhan-ud-din. An inconvenient statute of
limitations needed to be lifted first and Burhan-ud-din’s trial was
postponed. Khan, Sahgal and Dhillon were all accused of waging war
against the King in violation of Section 121 of the Penal Code. Dhillon
was further charged with murder in the deaths of fellow INA soldiers
Hari Singh, Duli Chand, Daryao Singh, and Dharam
Singh.[^^[177]^^](#_ftn177) Prem Kumar Sahgal was accused of abetment in
the murders of Hari Singh, Duli Chand, and Daryao Singh. Shah Nawaz Khan
was charged with abetment in the death of another INA soldier, Mohammad
Hussain. The three men were defended by a powerful defense team,
including none other than Jawaharlal Nehru himself, leading defense
counsel Bhulabhai J. Desai, the deputy Congress leader Asaf Ali, a
one-time minister of justice, 10 other lawyers and no less than 3
ex-judges.

This first INA trial has been well-studied but it is worth reviewing the
closing arguments and the outcomes of the trial. On 31 December, the
three accused were found guilty of waging war against the King,
sentenced to transportation for life, cashiering, and forfeiture of
arrears of pay. In announcing his confirmation of the sentence on 3
January the Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck quashed the life sentence and
retained only the cashiering and forfeiture of pay. Shiva Rao, a
journalist and later a Congress legislator was among the members of the
press allowed to attend the trial and offered one the most concise
appraisals of its proceedings. Respected as a moderate and reliable
correspondent, a letter he wrote about what he witnessed was passed on
to the Cabinet in London, “I am more than ever before convinced that
this trial is a first-class blunder.”[^^[178]^^](#_ftn178)

It was a blunder for several reasons. The choice of the accused was the
first disaster. The murders that decorated the treason charges made
them, as Peter Ward Fay has memorably put it, “turncoats who happened to
be brutes, not…brutes who happened to be
turncoats.”[^^[179]^^](#_ftn179) Yet these crimes of brutality, so
serious sounding in the charge sheet, turned out to consist of the
execution of 5 suspected INA deserters. Where were the tales of torture
and brutality that were promised? Wavell was not at all impressed by the
evidence for the murders, which “has not been such as to horrify the
normal Indian in any way.”[^^[180]^^](#_ftn180) Had the accused carried
out these executions out under British orders, they would be acts of
duty rather than murder. To make matters worse, the evidence for these
executions was so confused that Desai and the rest of the defense team
made a mockery of it, even to the point of denying that the murdered men
had ever been executed at all. All the murder charges were dismissed and
only a single charge of abetment to murder in the case of Shah Nawaz
Khan was sustained. Even in Khan’s case, no separate sentence for the
charge was issued above that given to him on the count of
treason.[^^[181]^^](#_ftn181)

The trial became, on the one hand, an experiment chamber for arguments
about international law and rights of belligerency, and on the other, an
opportunity for the defense to defend the honor of the INA and refute
the British arguments that it was filled with cowards and press-ganged
POWs. With the murder charges treated as a derivative of the primary
charge of waging war against the King, well over three quarters of
Desai’s 172 page-long closing address to the court was dedicated to
reviewing grander themes rather than the specifics of the violent acts
designed to single out the suspects for trial. In the case of defending
the honor of the INA, as the Judge Advocate General later noted in his
review of the legal issues, much of the court’s time was wasted by both
prosecution and defense in establishing a point of likely complete
irrelevance: the degree to which the INA consisted of coerced recruits
or patriotic volunteers.

On the role of international law in determining the validity of treason
charges, the Congress defense lawyers embraced two approaches. They
argued that INA volunteers were not bound by their oaths of allegiance
to the Indian Army because Britain failed to protect them following the
surrender in Singapore. Indian soldiers were, unlike other Western
soldiers, separated and “handed over” to the Japanese. As we shall see
in Chapter Five, an almost identical argument was later used by
Philippine lawyer and leading wartime collaborator Claro Recto, when he
argued that United States sovereignty over the Philippines was suspended
by virtue of its having abandoned its duties to protect its people.

A second approach taken in the INA trial was to argue, again using
precedents from customary international law, that the Provisional
Government of Free India had attained a degree of legitimacy and
international recognition over which the original state could not
“assert the provisions of his own criminal law as the only legally
relevant element in the situation.”[^^[182]^^](#_ftn182) The key
historic precedent invoked here was the British treatment of allied
Czechoslovak and Polish armies as co-belligerents in World War I, before
their respective states came to unambiguously rule over their own
territory. To prove the legitimacy of the Provisional Government of
India, the court found itself entertaining everything from descriptions
of Free India’s control of the school system in the Japanese-occupied
Nicobar islands to philatelist reports on the issuing of a stamp by the
new provisional government.

*Abstract Justice and Expediency*

The opening trial gripped the attention of the entire colony. Yet, the
violence allegedly committed by the accused that was to guide the
selection of those tried offered nothing of the brutality and atrocities
that might mitigate the powerful nationalist response to the treason
charges. “INA day” was declared on the opening day of the trial, on 5
November. It would be the first of many days of that name in communities
across India as rallies in support of the accused were organized, and
parts of Lahore and other areas of Punjab almost shut down completely in
protest.

On 6 November, Wavell sent a memorandum to Pethick-Lawrence predicting a
revolution following the elections in the spring with the INA as the
“spear-head of their revolt.”[^^[183]^^](#_ftn183) In November Wavell
received reports from several concerned provincial governors. A report
from the Governor of the United Provinces, Maurice Hallett, claimed that
revolutionary brigades had been formed at Benares and Allahabad, with
the latter trained by an INA veteran.[^^[184]^^](#_ftn184) In Benares,
an “agitator” threatened revenge on European children if the INA was not
left alone. The Governor of the Central Provinces, Henry Twynam, also
passed on threats of revenge in the event of INA executions. Twynam also
described a tense political atmosphere in the provinces that reminded
him of the rebellion of 1857, where troops once thought loyal could
suddenly support the mutineers.[^^[185]^^](#_ftn185) Finally, the
Governor of the North-West frontier province, George Cunningham came
straight to the point with his own frank recommendation: Auchinleck
ought to simply wipe the whole slate clean and take no further action
against the INA.

The colony was bleeding support with each day the trials continued. “The
thing is daily becoming more and more purely Indian *versus* British and
less and less ill-disposed Indians *versus* British-*cum*-well-disposed
Indians.”[^^[186]^^](#_ftn186) The predicted violence broke out 21
November, beginning with a demonstration in opposition to the INA trials
in Calcutta. Protests and violent riots continued there for nearly a
week. Some 33 died in the violence that grew out of the demonstrations,
including one American driver who burned to death in his vehicle. Almost
200 police, soldiers and fire brigade members (including 37 Americans)
as well as 200 civilians were also injured.[^^[187]^^](#_ftn187) Violent
protests spread to over half a dozen cities throughout India.

It was not long before colonial officials decided to revisit their
ever-shrinking list of trial candidates once more. In late November
Wavell and Auchinleck both caved to the intense pressure to reevaluate
their approach to future trials. Auchinleck in particular was deeply
concerned with the impact of broader Indian opinion on the Indian Army
as a whole.[^^[188]^^](#_ftn188) The Commander-in-Chief proposed a new
policy. The charge of waging war against the King was to be dropped in
all trials beyond those proposed in a newly compiled list. Auchinleck
conceded this might seem like condoning disloyalty, but “The principal
that treason cannot be condoned will have been vindicated by the
continuance of the present trials and the addition of the charge of
waging war in the further trials proposed.”[^^[189]^^](#_ftn189) Only a
few cases involving brutality would continue. Death sentences would be
commuted in cases where a soldier believed he was carrying out his duty.
Whereas this commutation might seem natural in retrospect, it should not
be considered a trivial move for an officer of the likes of Auchinleck.
At least from 1942 he was an ardent supporter of *reintroducing*the
death penalty within the British army for cowardice and desertion of
soldiers regardless of their origins, let alone deserters who
subsequently fought on the side of the enemy or were guilty of
brutality.[^^[190]^^](#_ftn190) He repeatedly pleaded that there be “no
hesitation in resorting to extreme measures” in order to establish
discipline in this regard.[^^[191]^^](#_ftn191)

During the course of a new narrowing of focus, the image of the
indignant POW and an Indian Army calling for vengeance vanished. As
Auchinleck reported, “There is evidence to show that there is no general
resentment in the Indian Army against the I.N.A.”[^^[192]^^](#_ftn192)
On the contrary, “general opinion in the Army” supported leniency, he
argued. Auchinleck’s new list of those to be tried for their treason was
appended to a draft communiqué about the new policy. It contained only
four additional names beyond the three already standing trial at the Red
Fort: Burhan-ud-Din, Shingara Singh, Fateh Khan, and Abdul Rashid.

Wavell disliked the idea of backing down as well as the idea of issuing
a new communiqué. “I think the harm is done now and that we should stick
to our guns,” he wrote in his journal, but he eventually accepted
Auchinleck’s proposals and the communiqué was issued on 1
December.[^^[193]^^](#_ftn193) Justifying the new policy in a telegram
to Pethick-Lawrence, Wavell wrote, “we have reached the conclusion that
abstract justice must to some extent give way to
expediency.”[^^[194]^^](#_ftn194) He now estimated that only 20-50 INA
members would now reach trial.

The INA-related violence died down for a time thereafter, though there
were more large-scale rallies following the 3 January confirmation of
sentencing and release of the three first INA officers to be tried. The
three cashiered officers toured the country as national heroes as the
trials of Burhan-ud-Din, Shingara Singh, Fateh Khan and Abdul Rashid
continued. Any of these four would have been better candidates for a
first trial emphasizing crimes of violence, though none of them were
charged with the scale of brutality against civilians that Indian
renegades and other military collaborators of Japan would be accused of
elsewhere in the aftermath of the war. Burhan-ud-Din was charged with
flogging an INA deserter to death. He was convicted of waging war
against the King and of causing grievous bodily harm and given a 7-year
sentence at the end of February. Singhara Singh and Fateh Khan were
convicted together in mid-March and sentenced to 14 years. They were
charged with three murders, two beatings and for waging war against the
King.[^^[195]^^](#_ftn195) The beatings and murders were of non-INA
Indian POWs and it was alleged they targeted those who refused to join
the INA.[^^[196]^^](#_ftn196)

The case of Abdul Rashid was unusual for several reasons. He rejected
the Congress defense team and sought counsel from Muslim League lawyers.
Accused of beating loyal Indian Army soldiers and of waging war against
the King, Rashid was the only one of the accused who denied that he had
joined the INA for nationalist reasons but insisted he did it to protect
other Muslims from Hindu dominance within the
organization.[^^[197]^^](#_ftn197) When Rashid was sentenced to 7 years
on 5 February, riots again broke out but in some areas showed a
distinctly more communal character.[^^[198]^^](#_ftn198)

Very little is known about subsequent INA cases which dropped the charge
of waging war against the King, but alleged various acts of brutality or
murder. These crimes included numerous acts of violence against Indian
Army POWs—the very kinds of cases that would have best addressed the
calls for justice from loyal POWs. The near complete obscurity of these
later trials, despite the huge publicity over the INA trials in general
suggests what an alternative approach to charges of INA brutality that
avoided treason charges from the start might have looked like. The final
statements of a few of these other INA members who faced trial in the
spring of 1946 are collected in a small volume published in May, 1946,
*The I.N.A. Speaks*. These include Puran Singh, sentenced to seven years
in late February for the shooting of POWs in an incident connected to
Fateh Khan’s case. A Jaswant Singh was sentenced to three years for
flogging prisoners in early March, 1946.

A one year sentence was given to one Nimbu, who did not deny accusations
that he flogged Indian POWs in the Bidadari Detention Camp, “The story
of flogging which is alleged in the seven charges against me might or
might not be correct as I have flogged under orders a number of
persons.”[^^[199]^^](#_ftn199) A Zaman Khan was charged with cruelty and
with using physical coercion to get Indian Army prisoners to join the
INA but was acquitted in late March. A short 2 May announcement declared
the end of prosecutions and the release of any INA personnel remaining
in custody who had not yet been convicted. All those charged with crimes
as part of the INA trials were released, at latest, on August 15, 1947
as part of a general amnesty, thanks to an agreement brokered between
Supreme Allied Commander of the South East Asia Command Louis
Mountbatton and Nehru.[^^[200]^^](#_ftn200)

The INA trials came at a great cost for the Raj. For Congress, the
trials were a golden opportunity. Maybritt Jill Alpes has argued that
Congress was able to effectively appropriate the trials, exclude Muslim
League participation in both the defense and in various political
activities associated with the anti-trial movement, and even bolster its
own anti-colonial standing in relation to the Communist Party of India,
which had strongly opposed the INA during the war.[^^[201]^^](#_ftn201)
The powerful message of inter-communal cooperation symbolized by an INA
which sought to overcome these divisions during the war, and the
spectacle of Muslim, Sikh, and Hindus all going to trial for what was
widely seen as crimes of patriotism was only disturbed once, with the
trial of Abdul Rashid. Congress was able to effectively put the colonial
administration on the defensive while at the same time work towards
co-opting a political and military force which had been nurtured under
the leadership of a political rival for power.[^^[202]^^](#_ftn202) For
the British administration, the cost in terms of instability was already
significant from the perspective of the November violence in Calcutta
and the early February violence following the sentencing of Abdul
Rashid. It may also have played a significant role in sparking the
mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy later that month.

Determining the impact of the INA and the INA trials on the Indian Army
was a more complicated matter. We have seen already the concerned
reports of the effects of the INA issue on military morale. Early in
1945 correspondence of the colonial leadership implied that officers and
soldiers within the Indian army had demanded harsh punishment. This was
gradually replaced with anecdotal evidence that the army was more
inclined toward leniency. On 13 February, 1946 Auchinleck distributed a
post-mortem to all army commanders on the question of what the impact of
the first INA trial had actually been on the Indian
Army.[^^[203]^^](#_ftn203) In preparation, he studied a large number of
reports from unit commanders and other sources. Auchinleck concluded
that the impact on the general public in India could be summed up as
“pleasure and intense relief” at the commutation of sentences on Shah
Nawaz, Dhillon and Sahgal in the first trial. When it came to Indian
officers in the Indian Army, Auchinleck found that the “vast majority”
were “glad and relieved” that the commutation avoided inevitable chaos.
Only “a few recovered prisoners of war” reacted differently. When it
came to the rank and file of the Indian Army, he found that there was in
fact very little interest in the trials, with the exception of technical
units, clerks, and the like. Again, those who had suffered at the hands
of the former INA in the camps might “feel bitterness” at the leniency
shown but these were estimated to be few in number.

Auchinleck excluded any survey of the opinions of the Indian Air Force
or Navy, but was confident that everything he said also applied to them
since, after all, they were better educated and politically minded.
Unfortunately, he couldn’t have been more wrong. Within a week of
writing the report, elements of the Royal Indian Navy mutineed in
Bombay, eventually involving the personnel of over seventy ships.
Whatever the driving causes of the mutiny might have been, its
participants cited the example of the INA as one of their main
inspirations. They sang INA songs during the mutiny, and included the
release of all detained INA members as one of the top political demands
of the rebellion.[^^[204]^^](#_ftn204) Auchinleck did make one exception
to his otherwise rosy assessment. The impact on British officers of the
Indian Army was said to have been “bad, and has led to public criticism
which has not been in accordance with the traditional loyalty I am
entitled to expect.”[^^[205]^^](#_ftn205) Apparently without irony, he
blamed this on the fact these officers were “not always very perceptive
or imaginative” and thus not able to grasp the delicate political
considerations of the trials. Resentful voices such as these, that had
been enthusiastically embraced to justify larger-scale trials early on
were now being chided as lacking perception and imagination.

Auchinleck’s letter to his commanders is revealing in two ways. In the
first we find him only interested in gauging responses to the
commutation of sentences–a decision which very clearly helped avoid a
deepening of the crisis but which came at the end of a long chain of
decisions. It would have been far more useful to carry out a similar
study of Indian Army perspectives, say, during the two months between
the August communiqué and the November opening of the trials. The
question posed then might have been the views of Indian Army soldiers on
holding any trials in the first place. Auchinleck’s letter also contains
clues to his own evaluation of the key moments in the events leading up
to the trials where things might have been handled differently. Should
the INA members have been dealt with summarily on the battlefield, he
asked. Should trials have been kept secret? The former he judged
impractical, especially when a whole INA division surrendered without
firing a shot. This ignored the fact that there was an active effort to
minimize summary courts of justice for INA members long before the
capture of Rangoon in 1945. On the question of secrecy for the trial
Auchinleck believed that this would deny the accused a fair trial. This
ignored the fact that it was standard practice in Britain to hold
wartime trials for violations of the Treachery Act of 1940 in secret and
execute those found guilty in similar obscurity.[[206]](#_ftn206) If
fairness been of paramount concern for the trials, then tampering with
the ordinances surrounding statutes of limitations to allow the trying
of inconveniently dated offenses seems equally unjust.

The most surprising omission in his report, however, was any
consideration of the relationship in the trials between crimes of
illegitimate violence and treason. It did not consider the possibility
of trials, such as those carried out by most Allied armies, that did not
include charges of waging war against the King. Nor did his report or
the debates in the fall of 1945 consider the alternative of trying those
accused of flogging regular POWs to death, shooting indiscriminately at
POWs, or of torturing POWs first, as was done in the case of the first
Japanese war crimes trial in Singapore. If they were purely crimes for
violence, rather than including charges of treason, it may have
significantly altered the political calculus as Congress fully backed
the INA defense. It is easier for us, decades after decolonization, to
imagine these alternatives. But this is part of the point: in the fall
of 1945 the balance of concern was so weighted towards a politics of
treason that it trumped the better judgment of fairly pragmatic
late-colonial officials. They were blind to the alternative of war
crimes trials that were already underway for Japanese soldiers, but
beyond this less realistic possibility, went out of their way to try, in
the most symbolic of places, treason together with violent crimes that
could just as well have handled in the relative obscurity of wartime
military courts, on a arbitrary scale of the Army’s choosing. The
“first-class blunder” of the Red Fort trials was certainly one of the
most important events in the final stages of decolonization on the
subcontinent. The INA rarely had the opportunity to participate in the
brutal counterinsurgency campaigns of Japan’s occupations, and thus the
crimes of brutality its soldiers were accused of were generally limited
to POW abuse and the execution of its own members. As the following
chapter shows, however, the early postwar trials would have an impact on
the handling of crimes more serious and larger in scale than those
considered in India.

\

**Chapter 3: British Renegades Beyond the Subcontinent**

The evaporation of political will for trying Indians who collaborated
with the Japanese is best remembered for its domestic impact within
India. It was seen as another stark symbol of the rapid weakening of
British power in its most important colony. The attempt to focus on
treason cases involving atrocities of the Indian National Army had not
only backfired as a way to dull opposition to what was widely seen as
purely political trials, but it was further embarrassing because the
trials failed to prove that the Indian National Army had engaged in
anything close to the brutality the Japanese military was known for.
Though some trials for atrocities without charges of treason continued
into the spring of 1946, they generally confirmed the image of a
liberation army that stayed focused upon its military goal and avoided
the darker consequences of military collaboration which sullied the
reputation of some of Japan’s other military allies. At worst,
nationalists could argue, there were a few misguided soldiers guilty of
POW abuse or the harming fellow Indians within the ranks of the INA.

This chapter considers the fate of “Indian renegades” beyond the Indian
subcontinent and argues that the policies established in India directly
impacted the politics of retribution in other colonies. If the INA
soldiers fighting on the Burmese front were able to avoid many of the
acts of brutality required to sustain military occupations, this was not
true for some Indians as well as other British imperial subjects across
Southeast Asia. It was also not true for members of the Indian Legion
fighting as far away as France where, during a desperate retreat, they
earned a fearful reputation for rape and pillage. Unburdened by the need
to consider political consequences or need to identify the actual
perpetrators of atrocities, French resistance forces shot more Indians
than were executed in the entire British Empire combined.

*Wartime Treason and Atrocities in Southeast Asia*

The conduct of the Indian National Army in Burma, and especially its
impact on the morale of other Indian forces was naturally the highest
priority for British officials but the INA was not its only concern.
Hundreds of thousands of Indian subjects resided in the concessions and
colonies of Britain stretching from Shanghai to Singapore, from Malaya
to British Borneo. Engaged in trade or directly serving local British
administrations, when Japanese occupations were established, Indians
were particularly vulnerable targets. The Japanese military saw them
both as a source of wealth to be squeezed, and unlike the Chinese
minorities that were often assumed to be hostile, Indians were actively
courted or coerced into an independence movement that was expected to
fully support Japan’s war effort. This support was often limited to
financial contributions or propaganda, but also included helping the
Japanese military police apprehend, torture, and liquidate suspected
resistance activists.

The questionable conduct of Indian subjects in the occupied territories
had already become a minor diplomatic issue as early as September 1942.
Adolf Berle, a U.S. assistant Secretary of State tasked with
intelligence liaison duties passed on to the British Foreign Office U.S.
concerns that Indians were being actively recruited by the Japanese in
occupied Hong Kong. Most alarming was a report that American internees
were being guarded by Sikh police.[^^[207]^^](#_ftn207) In formulating
its reply over the course of the month to follow, the Foreign Office
emphasized that the number of Indians believed to have been suborned by
the Japanese was low. These Indians in the Far East were, it explained,
“in a very difficult position” and that, given Japanese inducements, “it
is perhaps only natural that personnel such as the Hong Kong police
should prefer to continue their paid duty to leading the life of a
prisoner of war.”[^^[208]^^](#_ftn208) This more sympathetic view
mirrored the early leniency shown towards the INA. It was less common in
later communications and postwar trials but was supported by
intelligence reports coming in around the same time deploring the
conditions Indians were facing in Hong Kong while in Japanese custody.
Severe torture was reportedly meted out to uncooperative prisoners.
Around one hundred Indians faced ghastly medical conditions when they
were left on a hospital “hut” floor among “pools of blood, mucus and
pus” in the Argyle Street camp where many Indians were interned, and
several witnesses claimed that one Capt. Matreen Ahmed Ansari died in
the Ma Tau Chung Camp across the street after being castrated for
refusing to serve in the INA.[^^[209]^^](#_ftn209)

In Hong Kong it was Sikh police accused of working for the Japanese as
guards. In the Changi POW camp in Singapore Sikhs in the newly formed
Indian National Army were serving as guards for over 15,000 Allied
prisoners of war. There they were despised both as traitors and for
their cruelty.[^^[210]^^](#_ftn210) Only a few days before the Americans
reported their Hong Kong concerns, an INA firing squad under a Captain
Rawa carried out a Japanese order to execute four British and Australian
prisoners of war accused of trying to escape from the Changi
camp.[^^[211]^^](#_ftn211) After the war, Lieutenant General Fukuei
Shimpei was shot at the exact same location after being found guilty on
two counts of violating the law and usages of war, the second of which
was his command responsibility for the execution.[^^[212]^^](#_ftn212)
Complicity in this execution of Allied POWs was far more troubling than
any of the crimes members of the INA were prosecuted for at the Red Fort
or thereafter and, as General Fukuei’s trial suggests, was also seen as
a war crime. None of the Indian members of the firing squad who followed
Fukuei’s orders faced a similar fate.

During the war, none of the accusations against Indian guards at Changi
that would later find their way into POW memoirs had reached Indian
Political Intelligence. American claims that Sikh police were serving
the enemy so soon after the occupation of Hong Kong, however, renewed
British concerns about Sikh loyalties in Hong Kong leading up to the
outbreak of war in the Pacific. These concerns had grown out of a “steel
helmet incident” of late 1940 when 83 Sikh soldiers of the 20^th^ Heavy
Battery of the Hong Kong and Singapore Royal Artillery were
court-martialed in connection with a mass Sikh
insubordination.[^^[213]^^](#_ftn213) The issue of the collaboration of
Indian subjects in Hong Kong reemerged after the war in February 1946,
just as the imperial government was coping with the aftermath of the
Royal Indian Navy mutiny. The Commander in Chief in Hong Kong requested
permission from the War Office to proceed with treason trials for two
Indian watchmen from Punjab, Nand Singh and Jass Singh, who were accused
of having betrayed the presence of an American pilot to the
Japanese.[^^[214]^^](#_ftn214) The Chinese person who hid the pilot was
believed to have been executed, but the fate of the pilot is unknown.
The timing of this request could not have been worse, as the British
were already trying to contain the violent backlash associated with the
Red Fort trials.

As we saw in the previous chapter, the official policy towards Indian
“renegades” within India came to settle upon prosecutions of only a few
INA members who were directly guilty of violent crimes. The Hong Kong
case was an example of the far more lethal consequences of collaboration
with any occupier in the capacity of informer. Unlike INA soldiers
guilty of direct abuse of POWs, for example, these watchmen did not
themselves carry out any violence. Indeed, they could argue they were
merely performing the regular duties of their otherwise civilian
careers. However, their actions resulted in the death of a civilian and
possibly an American pilot.[^^[215]^^](#_ftn215) The British authorities
may have been tempted to ignore this Hong Kong case and follow a more
narrow definition of atrocities but they were faced not only with the
moral and potential diplomatic challenges the case of the watchmen
presented, but any lenient approach would have exposed a glaring
inconsistency in British treatment of various ethnic groups among its
imperial subjects. The solution was to extend the definition of
atrocities to include indirect responsibility for violence borne by
informants. This “partial departure” from the policy within India of
prosecuting only direct atrocities was necessary in Hong Kong, as one
official explained, “to cover cases of Chinese already under trial on
this account.”[^^[216]^^](#_ftn216) By April, 1946 the case was
permitted to go forward, and set a precedent for the handling of
informers in other areas where a British military administration held
sway.

In the Philippines, which would gain its independence from American rule
that same summer, the fate of Indian collaborators was in the hands of
the American Counter-Intelligence Corps and later the Philippine
courts.[^^[217]^^](#_ftn217) A list of fourteen suspected Indian
renegades who had been detained in the Philippines reached British
Indian Political Intelligence officers, but most of them had already
been released, sometimes on bail, pending an investigation. The bulk of
those under investigation consisted of local members of the Indian
Independence League, the civilian counterpart to the Indian National
Army. This group had raised money for the war effort, and its leading
members gave anti-imperialist speeches during the war. Only one of them,
one Abdul Khan, was accused of violence. A note by his name accused him
of serving “as spy and informer for the Japanese; was responsible for
the arrest, detention and torture of guerrilla suspects and was
responsible for the apprehension and execution of at least 1
Filipino.”[^^[218]^^](#_ftn218)

The fate of arrested Indians in Philippines is unknown, but none of the
accused Indian collaborators in the Philippines are found among the
heavy treason sentences reviewed by the Philippine Supreme Court, or on
the list of collaborators in the Philippines pardoned in 1953. In April,
1946, F. S. Tomlinson, the British acting Consul-General in Manila,
expressed doubt that any of their cases would go forward since, “under
the penal laws of the Philippines, aliens cannot be prosecuted for
treason.”[^^[219]^^](#_ftn219) This was true at the time the Indians
might have committed their acts. However, the article for treason in the
Philippine penal code had been specifically amended by executive order
in May, 1945 to address this perceived shortcoming. A new paragraph was
added, extending punishment for treason to any “alien, residing in the
Philippines.”[^^[220]^^](#_ftn220) It is not clear whether the new
legislation was designed to be used as an *ex post facto* law in the way
treason and war crimes laws were retroactively applied in many countries
after the Second World War. But only a few rare treason cases involving
complex issues of citizenship ever reached the attention of the
Philippine Supreme Court in the early aftermath of the war and none of
these involved a direct challenge to this amendment.

The fate of a small number of Indians in the Philippines was not likely
a matter of great concern. In Malaya and Borneo, however, the British
Military Administration (BMA) faced a problem of Indian collaboration
and atrocities that was both larger in scale and considerably more
complex. The recruitment of POWs among the ruins of a defeated Singapore
and the deployment of INA soldiers on the battlefields of Burma are the
best remembered scenes in the history of the INA. But it was in
Japanese-occupied British Malaya that thousands of mostly Tamil Indians
who had never served in the British military enlisted for the Indian
National Army, joined the Indian Independence League, or made
voluntary—though often voluntary in name only—contributions to the
Japanese war effort.[^^[221]^^](#_ftn221)

As in the cases of Hong Kong and the Philippines, Malaya and Borneo were
territories under a highly repressive Japanese occupation where
employment as police, military police auxiliaries or directly with the
Japanese military primarily meant active participation in local
counter-insurgency efforts infamous for their brutality. Two partially
overlapping prison rosters of Indian collaborators under investigation
in Malaya, including Singapore, from November, 1945 reveal the range of
crimes they were accused of.[^^[222]^^](#_ftn222) One of the lists
identified the suspects by the five categories of Tamil, Sikh,
(Nepalese) Gurkha, Bengali, or generic “Indian,” and contained 97
suspects, while the other listed 64 suspects with some 17 of the names
crossed out. Both included some suspects who were merely accused of
giving anti-British speeches, being “close” to the Japanese or of being
a member of the Independence League. Altogether there were 48 unique
individuals on the two lists who were claimed to be directly or
indirectly complicit in acts of brutality. The majority of these were
accused of: being jailers accused of torturing or killing prisoners,
being informers or agents for the Japanese military police, betraying
the location of hidden Allied personnel, or committing torture or murder
in their capacity as detectives or police working for the Japanese. For
example, one accused Tamil held in Penang jail, lance corporal N. A.
Nathan, alias “Speedy Punche,” was described as an “Official
‘Beater-up’” for the Japanese military police.[[223]](#_ftn223)

In December, 1945, only days before the first Red Fort sentences were
handed down in Delhi, a press communiqué of the military administration
reported that a total of 114 Indians had been arrested in Malaya. Some
were unconditionally or provisionally released shortly thereafter but
among 73 still under detention, 3 were accused of “war crimes,” 4 for
being Japanese informers and 15 of being collaborators who were “guilty
of crimes or acts of cruelty.” The remaining 51 detainees were accused
only of “collaboration,” mostly for their membership in the Independence
League.[^^[224]^^](#_ftn224) Only a few of these cases find mention in
press reports and, without court records or personal accounts, it is
hard to evaluate any of these claims from a summary list of this nature
or determine how many of the Indians finally made it past preliminary
hearing to trial. Both in official communications and contemporary press
reports there is considerable ambiguity about the specific crimes the
accused were to be charged with.

British jurisprudence, as of 1945, offered a wide array of laws to
choose from when it came to punishing collaboration and its
consequences, including the 1351 Treason Act in an amended form (the
accused were no longer, for example, subjected to the combination of
hanging, drawing, and quartering), the 1940 Treachery Act, the slightly
weaker 1939 Defense Regulation 2A, the Defense Regulation 31, the charge
of “waging war against the King” under section 121 of the Penal Code,
the Sedition Ordinance of 1938 Section 4, or the War Offenses Ordinance
1941 Section 3—all of which were used in various British proceedings
after the Second World War involving disloyalty and wartime adherence to
an enemy.[^^[225]^^](#_ftn225)

The descriptions of the specific alleged acts committed by Indians in
Southeast Asia were often vague, and it is likely that there was little
useful evidence to support the trial of those who were accused and
apprehended on the move by incoming British military forces. Writing
more generally of collaboration trials under the British Military
Administration throughout the region, the former Burma colonial officer
F. S. V. Donnison laments that, “instead of well docketed complaints
from prisoner of war and civilian internee camps, an overwhelming number
of ill-prepared allegations were received from the public mostly from
persons of little substance…Many accused persons had to be released…for
lack of sufficiently reliable evidence and it was becoming
clear…accusations were being made with little foundation and frequently
for motives of spite and revenge.”[^^[226]^^](#_ftn226) In Malaya,
Singapore, and Borneo, discharge notices and case dismissals, which were
reported in *The Straits Times* more often than convictions, confirm
this, again usually citing lack of evidence.[^^[227]^^](#_ftn227) A lack
of ready-at-hand evidence worthy of use in a trial, and an abundance of
accusations based on spite and revenge are hardly uncommon in newly
liberated societies. A lack of investigative resources and just as
importantly, the absence of political will to commit them is a better
explanation than poor quality of evidence contributed by “persons of
little substance” to explain the limited efforts to punish atrocities or
collaborators more broadly.

A more aggressive approach was taken by the returning British in
carrying out an administrative purge. In British Malaya and Borneo local
police forces were desperately needed both to reestablish order in the
aftermath of Japan’s collapse and carry out hundreds of investigations
of collaborators themselves comprised a large proportion of suspects in
collaboration and atrocity investigations. Many of these forces were
complicit in the brutality of the occupation. In the Philippines, as we
shall see in Part Two and in U.S. occupied South Korea many of the
occupation period constabulary and colonial period police were retained
and these officers soon became a powerful voice against any thorough
purge of wartime collaborators. By contrast, the British Military
Administration in Malaya dismissed almost a thousand officers who had
served the Japanese, including some 500 Sikhs.[^^[228]^^](#_ftn228) In
this respect, it resembled the approach taken by both Communist and
Nationalist administrations in China after Japan’s surrender. While they
did occasionally retain wartime police in urban areas for some weeks or
months, deep purges of police were carried out in the cities. The price
of this purge was greater for the British. While the expansive Chinese
Communist Public Safety Bureau and thousands of Nationalist police
officers trained in the Chongqing wartime police academy could replace
many of these newly vacant key positions throughout China, British
military and civilian administrative resources were already spread
extremely thin by the close of the war. Also, the British Military
Administration could not easily replace purged police with temporary
military police since the Indian soldiers deployed throughout the region
increasingly protested being used to maintain stability in the
empire.[^^[229]^^](#_ftn229)

For the Military Administration, public security was the paramount
challenge of the early postwar period, and few resources could be used
to collect or investigate allegations of collaboration, whether it be of
Malays, Chinese, Eurasians, Westerners, or Indian “renegades.” Nor was
there any pressure from above to pursue investigations of wartime
disloyalty with any vigor, even before a clarification of policy
regarding Indian collaborators came to have an impact on all colonial
subjects. A Special Court for collaboration cases under a variety of
laws against sedition, treason, and treachery was set up in October,
1945 in Singapore and later elsewhere in Malaya and British Borneo.
However, official policy in Malaya and Borneo was to, “dissipate as
speedily as possible whatever pro-Japanese sentiments may still remain.”
Therefore, “treatment of those who have collaborated with the enemy
should be founded on a tolerant view of their conduct,” with only strong
cases to go forward against “ringleaders” who engaged in propaganda, in
activities “calculated to assist the enemy’s operations” or against
those had applied for enemy nationality.[^^[230]^^](#_ftn230)

Despite these limitations, by late January, 1946, the BMA in Malaya was
ready to begin its trials of collaborators, including Indians, some of
whom were only suspected of having given seditious speeches, delivered
propaganda broadcasts or were members in the treasonous Indian
Independence League.[^^[231]^^](#_ftn231) The severity of these crimes
in the face of the King’s law seemed to be confirmed only a few weeks
earlier when the convicted traitor often referred to as “Lord Haw Haw,”
William James, was hanged in London for his wartime Nazi propaganda
broadcasts, despite doubts regarding his British
citizenship.[^^[232]^^](#_ftn232)

As the trials in Malaya approached, the New Democratic League of Indians
in Singapore sent a cable to Commander-In-Chief Claude Auchinleck
thanking him for his wise decision to remit the sentences of the first
Red Fort convictions and urged him to secure the release of all Indians
in Malaya.[^^[233]^^](#_ftn233) By the end of January, “a panel of top
rank lawyers” had been despatched from India to defend the accused,
reminiscent of the the powerful figures who stepped forward to represent
the accused at Red Fort and helped transform the proceedings into a
national spectacle.[^^[234]^^](#_ftn234) At the Southeast Asia Command
there soon emerged a concern that the general “tolerant view” that was
to be taken toward collaboration in Malaya was not quite tolerant enough
when it came to Indian subjects. The War Office was pressed to clarify
whether or not trials of Indians in Malaya were to follow the new
guidelines in India which dropped all of the simple treason
charges.[^^[235]^^](#_ftn235)

By February, only 10 simple collaboration cases involving Indians had
actually had reached trial.[^^[236]^^](#_ftn236) One reason for this
relatively low case number may have been the cumbersome process required
to bring collaboration cases to trial under the British Military
Administration in Malaya. The police were already overwhelmed with
regular crime and unrest in rural areas—including acts of violent
retribution against collaborators being carried out in the name of
Chinese and Malayan resistance groups. By contrast, a complex legal
arrangement to limit treason cases required that suspected collaborators
appear first before a special court, a district court, and only then
finally a trial before the superior court assembled to try collaboration
offenses under Proclamation 21 of the Malay Peninsula Division.

While discussions over the scope and jurisdiction of the Indian policy
continued, the trials of Indians, including that of a prominent lawyer,
S. C. Goho, were ordered postponed. Soon, however, the issue became more
pressing. As the transition from military to civilian administration
scheduled for March, 1946 approached, the risk that any ongoing trials
begun in military courts would have to be restarted in civilian courts
grew.[^^[237]^^](#_ftn237) In the meantime, the press focused on the
progress of other treason trials. Among these were a number of accused
Eurasian collaborators, including Charles Joseph Paglar, a physician and
president of the Eurasian Welfare Association, along with the couple
Charles Bell and 21 year-old Agnes Lee.[^^[238]^^](#_ftn238) The final
decision on how to calibrate the degree of tolerance in treason cases
given the new INA trial policy came from the War Office on 8 March, when
it ordered that no treason or collaboration cases should go forward in
Malaya and Borneo that did not involve atrocities or the newly included
category of informers. It also ordered that this once exclusively Indian
policy should be “extended to collaborators of all races who, in their
view, should be treated alike throughout Malaya and
Borneo.”[^^[239]^^](#_ftn239)

In Hong Kong, the policy arrived at in India as a result of the fallout
of the INA trials was expanded to target informers in order to punish
Indians along the same lines as Chinese subjects. In Malaya, Singapore
and British Borneo, the Indian policy to end trials of those guilty of
simple collaboration with the Japanese and focus on atrocities helped
determine the course for all remaining simple collaboration proceedings
against British colonial subjects. However, given that the directive was
issued only a few weeks before the reinstatement of civil
administration, and several months after the start of trials, it is not
clear how many accused collaborators benefitted from the new policy
until after their conviction, including Indians.

The extent to which the policy was followed in British Borneo as well as
in Malaya is also uncertain. It was in a very poor state to arrest
collaborators suspected of atrocities or carry out trials for them. The
only two prisons in British Borneo had been destroyed during the war.
Most of its Sikh dominated police force had been replaced in 1943 by
Japanese trained local recruits and, in the aftermath of the war was in
a “highly disorganized” state.[^^[240]^^](#_ftn240) In Sarawak, the
handful of BMA officials who assumed control after Japanese surrender
lacked knowledge of the local circumstances, and half of the pre-war
Sarawak Civil Service, which was to take control after the transition to
civilian administration, had died during the Japanese
occupation.[^^[241]^^](#_ftn241) One hint that the directive may not
have been fully carried out in Borneo comes from Jawaharlal Nehru, who
visited Malaya for a week after the new policy was adopted in mid-March.
Nehru had originally planned to honor the memory of the INA during his
time there, including the laying of a wreath on a war memorial for
them.[^^[242]^^](#_ftn242) Upon the request of Supreme Allied Commander
of the South East Asia Command, Louis Mountbatten, the Indian
nationalist leader agreed to cancel this event from his agenda and avoid
“actions which might impair the discipline of Indian
troops.”[^^[243]^^](#_ftn243) After his trip, however, on March 26,
Nehru wrote with concern to Mountbatton about Indians still in custody
in Borneo,

I have received some telegrams from Borneo informing me that a number of
prominent Indians have been tried and sentenced to long terms of
imprisonment for collaboration with the Japanese. I do not know all the
facts and it is not easy to find out without some assistance from the
proper governmental authority. I trust that the policy laid down in
Delhi and here in regard to cases of pure collaboration will also be
applied to Borneo and other parts of SEAC. If that is so, I imagine that
some of the persons sentenced will have their sentences commuted, unless
there are some other charges with regard to them.[^^[244]^^](#_ftn244)

As late as June, S. K. Chettur, the Indian Government representative for
Malaya conducted a tour of British and Dutch colonial territories in
Southeast Asia to inspect the conditions of Indian subjects, but his
goal was also to “study the situation” of Indian collaborators still in
custody.[^^[245]^^](#_ftn245) It is difficult to determine where exactly
things stood by late spring, 1946. According to F. S. V. Donnison, some
half of 1,392 complaints of collaboration in Malaya were dismissed
before reaching trial due to lack of evidence by January, 1946, but that
still leaves hundreds of cases.[^^[246]^^](#_ftn246) Similar wartime
conduct could result in very different outcomes and, depending on which
of the many possible charges were brought forward, some cases may not be
included in this count.

A few Indian, Malay, Chinese, and “Arab” police detectives and jailers
who continued to work under the Japanese, including one recipient of the
King’s Police Medal were brought to trial in the course of 1946. The
charges in these cases were not treachery, treason, or any of the other
many charges punishing adherence to the enemy that were collectively
referred to as “collaboration” cases. The British brought the far weaker
charges of “causing hurt” for having tortured and extracted confessions
during interrogations of suspects arrested during the Japanese
occupation, including victims who were only guilty of having listened to
foreign broadcasts or spread Allied news reports.[^^[247]^^](#_ftn247)
This is one of a few examples in the British Wmpire where wartime
atrocities of collaborators were punished completely outside of the
realm of laws relating to treason.

The defense in a similar Singapore police torture case of 1946 which
levied this charge, *Rex v. Alsagoff and others*, argued that accused
police officers Hussein Ali Alsagoff, Ignatius Carvalho, and Perianan
Suppiah were, “merely following orders,” and complying with the new
ordinances and practices of the Japanese wartime administration.
Employing a tactic that closely resembled a “suspended sovereignty”
argument used by many wartime collaborators in the Philippines that was
ultimately struck down by the Philippine Supreme Court in 1947, the
defense in this Singapore case attempted to convince the court that the
British Criminal Procedure Code was overridden by the Japanese
Maintenance of Public Peace and Order directive.[^^[248]^^](#_ftn248)
This argument was roundly dismissed, but compared to the potentially
heavy sentences of any collaboration related charges or to sentences
handed down to Japanese guilty of similar crimes in war crimes
proceedings, convictions for the beating and water torture of multiple
individuals under the law against “causing hurt” in this and other cases
resulted in very light sentences ranging from one to three years
imprisonment.[^^[249]^^](#_ftn249)

The impact of the extension of the Indian policy regarding collaboration
cases is somewhat clearer in a later accounting of trials in a *Straits
Times* article of November, 1946, coming over half a year after the
transition to a civilian administration. Based on reports from various
magistrates, it reported that out of a total 1,536 suspected
collaborators, 57 accused were released unconditionally when the War
Office ordered the extension of the Indian policy to the territories of
the British Military Administration in March, presumably because they
were wanted for simple acts of treason.[^^[250]^^](#_ftn250)

The small handful of death sentences announced in the press, though
several of these were later reduced to long prison sentences, include:
Doreen Wales de Silva and Manuel de Silva, accused of being military
police informers and convicted Feburary 8, 1946; Louis Phillip de Souza,
a 67 year old Eurasian convicted as a military police informer March 6,
1946; Fara Singh, a Sikh police officer in British North Borneo accused
of murdering five Chinese guerrillas, convicted June 16, 1946; Hamzah
bin Mat Ajar, a former Sergeant in the Malay regiment and later a police
officer under the Japanese convicted of killing three Chinese political
prisoners June 24, 1946; Che Abdullah Haji Shaikh Hassan, sentenced to
death for pointing out hidden British soldiers in 1942; Cecil Beings, a
Eurasian informer sentenced to death August 10, 1946; Tan Jim Tee, a
Chinese informer to the Japanese military police sentenced to death
April 6, 1947; A. Thamby Durai a police officer sentenced to death for a
lethal beating, and “Tuan” Karthingasu, a Ceylonese (Sri Lankan, most
likely Tamil) assistant to a Japanese officer also convicted of beating
a man to death and other crimes of brutality in September,
1946.[^^[252]^^](#_ftn252)

Those who were released shortly after the shift in policy in March
included the accused in the most intensely followed treason case, the
Eurasian community leader Charles Paglar, when the prosecutor in his
case, together with that of the suspected Indian collaborator S. C.
Goho, received orders “not to proceed,” without any clear reason
divulged or any exonerating dismissal offered.[^^[253]^^](#_ftn253)
Neither Paglar or Goho were accused of direct or indirect complicity in
atrocities and were thus prime examples of the sort of simple
collaboration case ordered dropped by the directive of the War Office.
When asked by the puzzled defense counsel if the announcement “not to
proceed” was the equivalent of an acquittal, the prosecutor, Wing
Commander Buttrose responded, “My instructions in this case, which have
come from the highest possible authority, are silent on this
question…”[^^[254]^^](#_ftn254) The new policy was not made public,
leaving both opponents and supporters bewildered. Shinozaki Mamoru, an
advisor and administrator in the Singapore military occupation
government who testified at Paglar’s postwar trial and was deeply
sympathetic to his friend’s cause, found it to be “an unusual verdict,”
with the judge announcing that the trial, “stood adjourned until the
accused’s natural death.”[^^[255]^^](#_ftn255)

At most, by extending to other territories the new Government of India
policy to prosecute only treason cases involving atrocities, colonial
authorities narrowed an already weak retribution process in Malaya.
Trials already faced bureaucratic obstacles, a general policy that
encouraged tolerance, and lacked investigative resources that were
addressing more pressing security needs. The extension of the Indian
policy might have had the laudable consequence of freeing up resources
to focus on the many acts of torture and murder carried out by military
and police collaborators during the occupation, but the scale of
proceedings continued to be relatively limited, despite the fact that
there was a strong public mandate for carrying out trials. Trying INA
officers with the crime of waging war against the King, together with a
limited number of crimes of violence against their own number did
nothing to quell suspicions of the political nature of the prosecutions
in India. In Malaya, there was considerable public interest and anger at
the failure to prosecute collaboration in general and those guilty of,
or indirectly responsible for atrocities in
particular.[^^[256]^^](#_ftn256)

The contrast between British retribution against the violent
consequences of informers, police, and other collaborators accused of
atrocities in Malaya, as compared to trials of Japanese war criminals by
the Southeast Asian Command for similar crimes is telling. From January
1946 to December 1948, 280 deaths sentences (222 confirmed) were handed
down in British war crimes trials, with 53 life sentences and another
477 sentenced to imprisonment, with a majority of these rulings in
Malaya and Singapore.[^^[257]^^](#_ftn257) There were over nine hundred
Japanese accused of war crimes and a similar number of collaboration
cases that were passed on to special magistrates. Compare these numbers
with the 85 total reported convictions for treasonous atrocities and
general collaboration. This number is nothing compared to death
sentences of Japanese war criminals, let alone the total number of
convictions. As a frustrated commentator complaining about the feeble
prosecutions put it in September, 1946, the day after another two
Japanese war criminals were executed in Malacca, “Unless Government
treats the collaborators in the way they have punished the war
criminals, the general public will regret that they did not become
Kempeitai informers or Kempeiho themselves.”[^^[258]^^](#_ftn258)

On the other hand, as Abu Talib Ahmad has pointed out, the spectacle of
British judges passing judgment upon mostly Malayan and Eurasian accused
collaborators or summarily dismissing thousands of local administrators
and police, was deeply unsettling to many.[^^[259]^^](#_ftn259) In a
move with more obvious political consequences for the remnants of
indirect rule, charges of collaboration with the Japanese were also used
to depose and, in at least one case, deport all but four pre-war Malay
Sultans.[^^[260]^^](#_ftn260) Other Malay local officials found
themselves on an ominous “Black and Gray” list being compiled by
returning British Field Security or Investigation
Teams.[^^[261]^^](#_ftn261) The racial complexities of retribution in
Malaya were further complicated by the prominent resistance role of the
Chinese in the Malayan Communist Party, which in turn formed the core of
the Malayan Peoples’ Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), as well as being
apparent in the particular vigor with which the Japanese forces carried
out mopping-up campaigns that often specifically targeted the Chinese
population, most infamously resulting in large scale massacres during
the early days of the occupation in Singapore.[^^[262]^^](#_ftn262) By
contrast, Malays were often overrepresented in Japanese wartime
institutional positions of authority, including volunteer armies that
explicitly avoided the recruiting of Chinese.[^^[263]^^](#_ftn263)

In postwar Malaya, the small number of British convictions of treasonous
atrocities was merely a fraction compared to a much larger scale process
of retributive violence outside the courtroom. This took place at the
same time in the form of liquidations and “people’s courts” that had
much in common with the trials organized by the Traitor Elimination
Bureau in Communist controlled areas of China that we will meet in
Chapter Seven. In Malaya this process unfolded throughout the occupation
in towns and villages within reach of the MPAJA and other organizations
claiming to act on behalf of the resistance. In areas where they
targeted widely reviled figures, this competing source of political
justice could help bolster the political legitimacy of an alternative to
British power.[^^[264]^^](#_ftn264)

As we have seen, there were significant connections between the treason
prosecutions on the subcontinent and the postwar policy in Southeast
Asia both for Indians and other colonial subjects. But the process took
place in areas that, unlike India, had endured harsh occupations without
anything resembling the limited local control offered in Burma following
its nominal independence in 1943—a case that we will consider shortly.
The eventual British trials in Malaya, Singapore, and though less
evidence is available, most likely British Borneo as well, were scaled
down as a result of INA trials in India in an effort to treat colonial
subjects equally. The considerable attention paid to Indian cases in
particular was an expression of British fears of the destabilizing
effect of the issue—and not merely on Indian domestic politics. The
political stability of a population of over half a million Tamil and
other Indian migrants throughout Southeast Asia who often found
themselves significantly worse off than they were before the Japanese
occupation was a serious concern. More importantly, the large number of
Indian forces who still served in a British military needed for
deployment all over the former Japanese empire reminded colonial
authorities that the “Indian renegade” issue impacted not only the
course of a British exit from India, but its imperial and strategic
interests throughout the region.

*Atrocities and Executions of the Indian Legion*

The trials in India ended with deaths in the street but almost none
before a firing squad. In Southeast Asia, sentences were again light,
and postwar trials trivial in scale. As previously mentioned, there was
a small number of accused infiltrators and INA members shot or hanged in
1943 and 1944 within India and near the Burmese war front, but the
Courts of Inquiry that might have led to many more were crippled by
special order. There was one other place where Indian “renegades” faced
execution for their wartime service on behalf of the Axis powers:
France. The fate of a retreating Indian Legion in 1944 contrasts
significantly with the retreat of the INA in Burma. The latter had
reportedly good relations with a local Burmese population that had good
reason to feel uneasy about the returning British Army. In France, the
Indian Legion was not only made up of racially foreign soldiers, but
served in a brutal German occupation that had little local sympathy and
no complicating colonial context. In other words, the Legion faced
almost uniformly hostile territory during its final retreat, the most
challenging environment for the conduct of any army.

In France the issue was entirely unclouded by questions of treason and
disloyalty and was based instead upon outrage against atrocities
combined with, very likely, a strong racial component. In the violent
interregnum between the retreat of German forces from occupied France
and the establishment of a new government under a Gaullist
administration in the summer and fall of 1944, local French resistance
groups carried out a violent “purification” (*épuration sauvage*) of
local collaborators with little or no recourse to judicial
procedure.[^^[265]^^](#_ftn265) The infamous French militia, suspected
Gestapo informers, and local Vichy officials and sympathizers were not,
however, the only victims in this final stage of a vicious cycle of
reprisals that accelerated rapidly after the June Allied landings in
Normandy. Enemy soldiers and administrators, including some Georgians
and other nationalities fighting on behalf of the Germans, were
occasionally shot by French irregulars before reaching reaching
detention camps. They were executed with or without summary trial as
accused war criminals, or, in imitation of a well-established German
wartime practice, executed as hostages in reprisal for victims of German
atrocities in nearby areas still under occupation.[^^[266]^^](#_ftn266)
Among the targets of this summary justice were almost three dozen Indian
soldiers of Infantry Regiment 950: The Free India Legion.

The Legion was the first military creation of the future leader of the
Indian National Army, Subhas Chandra Bose. Before making his way by
German and then a Japanese submarine to Japanese controlled Indonesia in
early 1943, Subhas Chandra Bose secured German support for a “Free India
Center” in Berlin in the spring of 1941. The center served primarily as
a source of propaganda against the Allies and in favor of Indian
independence. It was also key to the formation of a military unit under
German command composed, for the most part, of several thousand former
Indian POWs. Compared to the INA, the Indian Legion was a disunited and
deeply demoralized unit, especially after Bose left them behind in 1943
to pursue more promising mobilization efforts with Japanese support.

Indian soldiers who had so recently suffered the discrimination of life
in the British Army now found themselves under even worse masters, as
one Viennese interpreter for the Legion, Leopold Fischer, remembers,
“British officers had at least been tactful in their relations with
Indian troops, whereas the attitude of the Germans was tactless and
overbearing…”[^^[267]^^](#_ftn267) At the same time, their German
officers were envious of one of the benefits the Legion’s Indians
received that helped keep their spirits up: a supply of valuable Red
Cross packages that they should only have received while they were
POWs.[^^[268]^^](#_ftn268) Denied the opportunity to participate in any
direct way in the liberation of India and frequently divided by internal
strife and courting mutiny against their German officers, the soldiers
of the Indian Legion were increasingly convinced they would meet an end
as convicted traitors or else perish in a hopeless retreat fighting for
a cause that was never their own.

The June, 1944 Allied landings in Normandy found the bulk of the Indian
Legion deployed on the coast near Bordeaux. Their last chapter began in
August with the Legion being transferred, like many other foreign
volunteers, to the control of the Waffen-SS, one of many orders that
troubled some of the Legion’s increasingly reluctant soldiers. Within
days, the Legion was ordered to begin a lightning “redeployment” to
prevent encirclement by the Allies, a threat made all the more pressing
following landings on the Mediterranean coast on 15 August. During their
retreat, the over two thousand Indian troops joined a ragtag rear guard
of some ten times as many that came to be known as “Elster’s column”
after its commander, Major General Botho Elster. Most of this German
column, almost daily harassed by Allied bombardment and ambushes by the
French resistance, surrendered in September, but the majority of the
Indian forces escaped France by early October.[^^[269]^^](#_ftn269)

The retreat of the Indian Legion covered more than a thousand kilometers
of hostile French territory, much of it on foot and bicycle. Though it
was a harrowing experience, it resulted in surprisingly few Indian
losses.[^^[270]^^](#_ftn270) One battalion of the Indian Legion carried
out anti-partisan raids in the weeks before the retreat, which may have
contributed to local hostility. However, one of the Legion’s soldiers,
Gurbachan Singh Mangat, claims that the legion reached an oral
understanding with French resistance forces which prevented any
harassment during the first segment of the retreat up until they reached
Ruffec, about 65 kilometers south of Poitiers.[^^[271]^^](#_ftn271) But
it was from around this point of the retreat, and especially after they
passed Poitiers, the Indian Legion became widely reviled by the local
populace, which accused it of carrying out rampant looting, acts of
brutality, and rape. Claims of Indian atrocities made their way into
reports by the mayors of Sainte-Gemme, Chateouroux, and Poincennet which
detailed the violence that accompanied the passage of the Legion in late
August and early September.[^^[272]^^](#_ftn272) An otherwise admiring
interpreter for the Legion, Leopold Fischer, did not spare the soldiers
criticism in his memoirs,

The four weeks retreat through France were hard and bitter for me—not
because of the retreat itself…but because my enthusiasm for everything
Indian received its first hard knock. The reason for this was that some
of the legionaries behaved like beasts. Only a small minority did, it is
true, but a drop of ink in a glass of water is enough to discolour the
whole; and because of their abominable behavior the whole Legion got a
bad name. To my knowledge there were five cases of rape during the
retreat, and all the victims were young girls under twenty. One of our
fellows named Ghulam Jilani, from the Fifth Company, openly boasted that
he had raped a twelve-year old girl. A week later a bullet got
him.[^^[273]^^](#_ftn273)

According to Hans Kutscher, who served as an adjutant and later
commander of the third battalion of the Indian Legion in its final days
before going on to become a judge on the German Federal Constitutional
court from 1955-1969 and president of the European Court of Justice from
1976-1980, “during the retreat the commanders had to deal with severe
breaches of discipline among their Indian soldiers,” and specifically,
“the problem was to make the Indians understand that the French women,
now on the side of the enemy, were not fair game.”[^^[274]^^](#_ftn274)
Courts-martial were held in at least four rape cases, though in one
trial the main witness to the crime excitedly identified a Sikh judge in
the case as the perpetrator of the rape, rather than the accused, which
suggests the complicating racial component of the interaction between
the Legion and the populace.[^^[275]^^](#_ftn275) A September *Le
Figaro*article claimed that the head of the retreating column, General
Elster, took responsibility for the atrocities of the passing Indian
Legion, and paid several million francs in compensation to a local
French prefect.[^^[276]^^](#_ftn276) The memoirs of Legion members deny
any serious misconduct. The accounts of the retreat by former
legionaries Mangat and N. G. Ganpuley both note the difficulties in
making their way back through hostile territory but have nothing to say
about atrocities. Ganpuley merely notes that, “After the war, the French
Government tried to hold the Legion responsible for the little damage
and destruction of this march route; but who has ever heard of troops
allowing their way to be blocked wantonly?”[^^[277]^^](#_ftn277)

On 22 September, only a few days after the passing of the Indian Legion,
a Government of India liaison officer, a Major de Gale, was dispatched
on a “Mission to Endeavor to Get In Touch with Members of the Free
Indian Legion.”[^^[278]^^](#_ftn278) Picking up clues to their
whereabouts and interviewing a few stragglers as he made his way from US
lines into liberated areas under the control of the French resistance,
he attempted to locate any and all captured legionaries in French hands
when he stumbled upon some unsettling news,

From Poitiers I went to Bourg-Archambault where I was informed that the
Indian prisoners (89 in number) had been made over to a Capt. ANATOLE
(an F.F.I. nom-de-guerre) of the “Groupes la Panthere” on 19.9.44, that
some of these had been shot on the way to Poitiers and that a number had
been shot later in the Place d’Arme of Poitiers about
22.9.44.[^^[279]^^](#_ftn279)

Returning to Poitiers the unnamed officer confirmed the execution of 27
Indian prisoners in the main square on 22 September. He also discovered
that almost all Indian prisoners still held in the area were, in fact,
not captured on surrender but were legionaries who had deserted to
French lines. “It is unfortunate, therefore, that the least guilty of
the Indians of the “Free India Legion” should have been shot,” observed
de Gale.

Major de Gale, later interrogated two German officers who deserted at
Ruffec with the legionaries who were executed: the medical officer Dr.
Koch-Grünberg and the chaplain Ernst Bannerth.[^^[280]^^](#_ftn280) The
Germans who, unlike the Indians, had not received mistreatment at French
hands, claimed that they had been turned over to French resistance
forces who were “unacquainted with the circumstances” of their desertion
and that tragically, “The men shot where the most anti-Legion men in the
Legion.”[^^[281]^^](#_ftn281) Because of the “ill-feeling against
Indians” in Poitiers, Major de Gale was not able to get the remaining
Indian prisoners released, but after some difficulty eventually managed
to have them removed to a special camp exempted from labor. Later
reports from de Gale reported more executions. Six Indians were shot
further northeast at Bourges, and another captured Indian put before a
firing squad a few kilometers south of Bourges in Levet, all in the same
month of September, 1944.[^^[282]^^](#_ftn282)

With this handful of incidents, French resistance forces carried out
more recorded executions of Indians who fought under the Axis powers
than did British military administrations all over the empire or in
other territories liberated from Japanese control combined. The actual
circumstances of the French summary trials and executions of these
Indian soldiers are not well understood. Given how rapidly the Indian
troops were moving across France, mostly at night, and the fact that
they were all executed in the same month that the atrocities were
committed, it seems unlikely that much of an effort went into trying to
establish whether or not any particular captured Indian was in fact
guilty of the crimes reported. Doing so would have been a considerable
challenge given the wide spread of territory under divided control
between different resistance groups or local administrations. As in the
case of the German court-martial in which the witness to a rape
identified a completely unconnected Sikh as the perpetrator, the
unfamiliarity of the local French population with South Asians in
general may well have led to racist generalizations.

However, though frightening reports of rape and pillage at night by
exotic looking Indians might have played an important role in
aggravating retribution, it is important to see the retribution against
the Indian Legion for atrocities in the context of the broader violence
of the moment of liberation. The Indians were far from the only
foreigners to pass through. There were many Soviet citizens, including
escaped or deserted Georgians, Russians, and Tartar units of the
Wehrmacht, laborers who served in the Todt military engineering
organization, and units of Vlassov’s Russian Liberation Army who also
became feared in Poitiers and the region of Limoges for their disorderly
and violent conduct.[^^[283]^^](#_ftn283) Nor were the Indians the only
foreigners to become targets of summary retribution at the hands of the
French resistance. A number of Georgians who had served in the German
military and served as jailers in the coastal town of Vannes were
executed for brutalities they committed, including alleged acts of
castration.[^^[284]^^](#_ftn284)

Secondly, while German accounts of the Legion’s retreat emphasizing the
orderly courts-martial of Indians for rape and reports of General
Elster’s compensation to the local population for atrocities might
suggest that the German officers did their utmost to control unruly and
undisciplined legionaries, the terrible German atrocities against
hostages and civilians did more than anything to set the stage for the
violent acts of retribution by the resistance in the fall of 1944 and
the spring of 1945. For, example, when the inhabitants in Angoulême and
Châteauroux, or elsewhere on the roads east of Poitiers faced the
violence of the passing Indian legionaries at the end of August and in
early September, only a few months had passed since the wholesale
massacre by German soldiers of over six hundred villagers, including
women and children, in Oradour-sur-glane on 10 June, 1944, located in
the neighboring department of Haute-Vienne. Koch-Grünberg and Ernst
Bannerth may have been spared the fate of their fellow Indian deserters
in Poitiers, but elsewhere German soldiers were summarily shot by the
resistance, as were French militia forces who engaged them in what
amounted to a civil war across the French countryside.

Another factor is the importance of local circumstances. The scale of
retribution differed significantly according to the state of German
retreat, local sympathies towards the Vichy regime, the power of local
resistance groups, and strength of the authority of commissioners
despatched by the new Republican government. There are no reliable
statistics for summary executions and considerable debate over their
scale throughout France, but even when considering only the special
courts or “Cour de Justice” set up to try collaboration following a
June, 1944 ordinance, the Poitiers judicial district handed down 272
death sentences; the highest number of death sentences in France not
given in absentia.[^^[285]^^](#_ftn285) Poitiers was a particularly
troubled site of conflict between contending resistance forces, who
flowed into the town after its liberation in early September, and the
assigned comissaire Jean Schuhler.[^^[286]^^](#_ftn286) Visiting
Angoulême, Schuhler found that “arrests were made without rhyme or
reason…”[^^[287]^^](#_ftn287) When he attempted to transfer Colonel
Fourrier, the commanding military officer who Major de Gale had
negotiated with over the fate of Indian prisoners, out of the department
in December, 1944, a demonstration starting from the square where the
legionaries were executed on September 22 marched to the prefecture and
broke into the building.[^^[288]^^](#_ftn288)

In this environment of casual violence by armed groups or isolated
units, burning hatreds against war criminals, collaborators, as well as
any unfortunate captured enemy could mix freely and without great
distinction. If the attempt to punish the violent crimes of war by the
Indian National Army or other Indian collaborators became intricately
tied to an explosive politics of treason in the British Empire, the
experience of the Indian Legion in France offered no alternative model
to follow: the execution of several dozen Indians in the towns of
central France was carried out in the worst possible context for
transitional justice, lacking anything resembling a fair judicial
process.

This chapter has argued that British policies towards the Indian
National Army in India contributed to the weakening of an already nearly
crippled retribution process in Southeast Asia. Taken as a whole,
however, considering the differing contexts and fates of “Indian
renegades” beyond the subcontinent reminds us that the varying scale and
nature of violence during the war varied as much as its relationship
between the politics of betrayal and retribution for violence in the
postwar response. In the case of the former, one important contrast is
between the conduct of armies in the battlefield and security forces
maintaining occupations or managing prisoner of war camps. However, the
relationship with the local population was just as important. Both the
INA and the Indian Legion faced their greatest challenge during long
retreats, but the latter was a demoralized force in an overwhelmingly
hostile environment. These different contexts are also important when
considering post-conflict responses. If the political dimension
introduced by the crime of treason led to explosive results in India, it
further muffled any attempt to reckon with violence in Southeast Asia.
And as the case of the executions in France suggest, summary courts in
the field were anything but a just alternative.

\

**Chapter 4: Confronting Treason and Atrocities in Burma, 1944-1946**

We have seen that policies towards the Indian National Army within the
Raj gradually evolve into one that punished only treasonous atrocities.
We have also seen this policy extend to all collaborator cases in Hong
Kong, Malaya, Singapore and British Borneo. These shifts came at a high
cost with very little to show for it. In India the few cases which came
to trial were widely perceived as the petty political maneuvering of a
dying empire, while the developing focus upon wartime brutality, as
opposed to treason, by the spring of 1946 did not result in any
significant intensification of efforts to achieve a reckoning with the
violent consequences of wartime military and police collaboration in
British territories under Japanese occupation.

Burma was also under control of a British Military Administration during
the period of transition at the close of the war but there are a number
of features that set it apart from the experience of other British
domains in Southeast Asia. Unlike any other place the British Empire
returned to, in Burma colonial officials had to face a full fledged
Burma National Army (BNA), raised and trained with the help of the
Japanese military. Instead of a defeated and discredited force, the BNA
reversed its loyalties at the last minute to fight against the Japanese
and join the victory parade in Rangoon. Also, Burma had served as an
active battleground for most of the war and the opposing forces
exacerbated existing ethnic tensions as they sought local support. The
returning British faced a battered colony after the war, but one in
which local nationalist sentiment had been boosted by the nominal
independence awarded it under the Japanese in 1943. The important role
of the BNA and its leaders, both as a threat to reestablishing British
rule and as potential partners in the creation of a newly independent
Burma, made the question of retribution for military collaborators
particularly vexing.

The case of Burma is also made more complex because, though a British
colony, was not merely the British military and returning colonial
officials who determined the fate of its “renegades.” Only at Normandy
did the Allies launch a counterattack with a greater variety of forces
than were deployed in the jungles of Burma. As the Japanese Imperial
Army slowly retreated in the course of the late 1944 and 1945, it faced
Allied armies composed of more than half dozen different origins and
ethnicities. Indians fought side by side with British soldiers and
officers of the Indian Army. Various ethnic groups within Burma fought
in guerrilla units under British and American command. In the vast
northern interior it was American soldiers and officers fighting
together with tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers who pushed the
Japanese to the south and southeast. Unsurprisingly, in these areas the
Americans and Chinese would help determine the fate of many of those who
aided the Japanese. Agents of the U.S. Counter-intelligence Corps (CIC)
actively arrested and sometimes even executed local collaborators,
treating them as both threats to security, and as individuals guilty of
illegitimate violence. These CIC agents were not concerned with acts of
treason as such but with ongoing threats to Allied progress in the war,
and with past acts which in most contexts would simply be called war
crimes.

By contrast, for the returning British administration, the issue of
military collaboration was, above all, a political problem. This was
especially true after Japanese surrender. As challenges mounted in Burma
during the course of 1946, the scope of all investigations and trials
for wartime treason and other crimes committed by colonial subjects
under Japanese occupation rapidly narrowed. Ultimately, however, when
all cases of “simple collaboration” had been dropped and prosecutions
only retained for those involving torture or resulting in death, it was
found that they still inconveniently included the most important Burmese
political figure of the early postwar period, Aung San. Facing the risk
of losing an important stabilizing partner and with him, the best
prospect for a peaceful end to British rule in Burma, a new approach to
punishing wartime crimes in Burma was adopted. In July, 1946, just as
Rangoon-based war crimes trials against the Japanese were picking up
their pace, the acting governor for Burma issued a decree which not only
prevented the trial of Aung San, but effectively brought an end to all
proceedings against Burmese accused of wartime treason and atrocities.

*Japan’s Burmese Armies and the Indian National Army*

The Japanese trained Burma Independence Army, later reorganized as the
Burma Defense Army and once again renamed the Burma National Army, has
received less attention than the more famous Indian National Army, but
it played a more significant military role during the war, both during
Japan’s invasion of Burma at the opening of the campaign in 1942 and,
more spectacularly, when it turned on its master in the final months of
Japan’s retreat in 1945. Like the Indian National Army, the Burmese
forces that fought for the Japanese, and then later against them, also
left an important postwar legacy. When the British attempted to
reestablish control in Burma, the existence of thousands of Burmese
soldiers, including hundreds of well trained officers, played an
important part of every major political calculation that led up to
Burmese independence in January, 1948. Its leading officers went on to
play central roles in almost all the violent shifts in political power
that followed, well into the 1960s.

In Burma, as in India, the British Empire’s frustrations with its
treasonous subjects led to debates over how to punish the guilty without
aggravating the empire’s already precarious position. As in India, the
question of how and who to target began as one dominated by the issue of
treason, was gradually reduced to focus on traitors who were guilty of
war crimes, and then shifted to examining only the war crimes of a
single class of military collaborators. In both cases the British faced
the awkward question of punishing traitors in colonies that were seen as
rapidly approaching a period of self-rule, if not complete independence.
In both cases the pragmatic and utilitarian instincts among British
military and colonial officials prevailed over the rule of law or any
desire for retribution against traitors or the violent crimes they may
have committed.

There are, however, at least two important differences between the
Indian and Burmese cases. While Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National
Army suffered an increasing number of desertions during the course of
the Japanese retreat, for the most part it continued to fight with its
Japanese allies through to the final defeat. By contrast, the Burma
National Army rose up against the Japanese in the spring of 1945 and
hastened Japan's expulsion from Burma. As Japanese casualties at the
hands of the Burma National Army mounted, there was an increasing
consensus that these forces had, in a phrase often used in official
British correspondence, “worked their passage home,” and thus removed
the stain of collaboration.

 A second difference is at least partly attributable to the impact of
one case upon the other. As it debated the question of wartime military
collaboration in Burma, British officials never let the similar case of
the Indian National Army stray far from their mind. In both India and
Burma the British government attempted to make a clean distinction
between those who were merely guilty of treason or of waging war against
the King, an offense for which, as we have seen, the death sentence had
in some cases already been carried out during the war, and those who
were additionally guilty of wartime atrocities.[^^[289]^^](#_ftn289) In
India, however, the British finally moved forward with some
prosecutions, if only against a few men, in the “Red Fort trials” from
late 1945 to early 1946. The unified opposition within India engendered
by these trials and the violence they sparked were noted carefully by
government officials who feared any escalation of political violence in
Burma. The final decisions on the Burmese cases were taken at the time
these events were unfolding in India and thus had a very direct impact
for two reasons. Violence like that which broke out in India was
predicted for Burma as well. Perhaps more importantly, the substantially
weakened British rule in Burma had been for many decades heavily
dependent upon the use of Indian troops, whose loyalty was now more than
ever in doubt.

*Burmese Military Collaboration*

Unlike most other Southeast Asian cases, Japanese sponsorship and
training of Burmese military forces began even before its rapid Southern
advance.[^^[290]^^](#_ftn290) The earliest such plans were developed by
officers of the Japanese Navy General Staff in 1940 but led to concrete
action under the supervision of army Colonel Suzuki Keiji (鈴木敬司) and
his newly formed intelligence organization, the *Minami
Kikan*(南機関)*,* in February, 1941.[^^[291]^^](#_ftn291) Thirty Burmese
of the Thakin group of student nationalists received military training
from Japanese Naval officers in occupied Hainan.[^^[292]^^](#_ftn292)
These famous “Thirty Comrades,” as they became known, including the
leading military figure Aung San, would become the core of a Burma
Independence Army (BIA), which was formally established in December, on
the eve of the Pacific War.

The BIA was divided into four groups, including one led by Colonel
Suzuki and an interior sabotage group under Ne Win, who would to go on
to become Burma’s longest ruling military dictator in the postwar
period.[^^[293]^^](#_ftn293) The BIA expanded rapidly and organically in
the early stages of the Japanese campaign into Burma in 1942 and it
helped to rapidly consolidate control in rural areas. One leading
Burmese Communist, Thein Pe Myint, records the growth of one of the more
famous units, under Bo Yan Naing, which left Bangkok with 24 men, grew
to a force of 900 when it left Mergui, and had 1,200 soldiers when it
reached its first significant battle at Shwedaung.[^^[294]^^](#_ftn294)
Estimates of total numbers vary widely, and are complicated by the
relative lack of Japanese control over membership in the earliest stage.
The detailed study of the Japanese occupation of Burma by Ōta Tsunezō
(太田常蔵) estimates that, at the occupation of Rangoon, the BIA
numbered only around 10,000 regular forces, but that it grew to be
supplemented by as many as 100,000 irregular
militia.[^^[295]^^](#_ftn295) The rapid expansion of its irregular
forces to include many Burmese without any training and hardly any
equipment helps explain Ian Morrison’s comment, writing in 1947 that,
“The term B.I.A. suggests an army. In reality it was little more than a
horde of undisciplined riff-raff.”[^^[296]^^](#_ftn296) Everywhere the
new Burmese army advanced, they established local administrations,
though this appears to have been the result of a mix of direct BIA
initiatives and local groups who wished to find new legitimacy for their
power. As Thein Pe Myint describes the phenomenon,

Some Thakins in the districts were more eager to be appointed
administrators and presidents of peace committees than to carry a rifle
and join the march. Everywhere the BIA column passed through, the local
Thakins would generally ask for power and authority to rule, to reign,
to strut and swagger with pearl-handled pistols dangling from their puny
waists, to settle their old personal scores, to set up their own mean
little kingdoms.[^^[297]^^](#_ftn297)\
 \

These Burmese forces did not play any significant role in the major
military operations of the initial campaign against the British and
Chinese forces in Burma, given the Japanese 15th and Southern Army's
lack of faith in their fighting capabilities. In fact, direct clashes
between the Japanese military and its Burmese allies began almost
immediately, with BIA forces marching north on the west bank of the
Irrawaddy river fighting two major battles with Japanese forces of the
55th Division.[^^[298]^^](#_ftn298) Tensions between Imperial Army
commanders who found them an annoyance and Colonel Suzuki, who believed
in their capacity to grow into their role as a national army, deepened
as the latter pressed for rapid Burmese independence. The Minami Kikan
was dissolved and the Colonel sent back to Japan in July, 1942. The
unruly size of the BIA, its relative independence from Japanese control,
and the removal of its most fervent supporter Suzuki from the scene
contributed to the rapid dissolution of the BIA by the Japanese 15th
Army and the reorganization of some of its members into a smaller Burma
Defense Army (BDA). Its guiding principles were that it was to be “under
the command” of the Japanese military and that it would focus on
guarding border regions and “concentrate themselves in drilling and
equipping.”[^^[299]^^](#_ftn299) This new force was better trained but
not permitted to conduct any military operations without approval of
Japanese officers that were assigned to its units.[^^[300]^^](#_ftn300)
Following the declaration of Burma's independence in August 1943, this
BDA was in turn reorganized into a Burma National Army (BNA) with Aung
San occupying the positions of commander and later as Minister of
Defense.[^^[301]^^](#_ftn301)

As was the case in most Japanese controlled territories, Japanese
military as well as diplomatic foreign policies regarding the
nationalist aspirations of the Burmese were completely lacking in
consistency for much of the war.[^^[302]^^](#_ftn302) This led to
considerable distrust and frustration on the part of nationalists
collaborating with Japan already by the end of 1941. The decision to
finally grant a nominal independence for Burma and the Philippines,
announced by Prime Minister Tōjō Hideki   (東条英機) in late January
1943, was made as the Japanese Empire shifted to a defensive strategy
and was motivated by the need to regain the support of disenchanted
Burmese nationalists.[^^[303]^^](#_ftn303) It came at a time when final
Japanese evacuation from Guadalcanal had begun, and a first failed
Allied counter-offensive had begun in Burma.

The granting of independence failed to stem the gradual decline in trust
and confidence among the Burmese. Nor did the training and
reorganization of Burmese military forces in a newly established
Officers’ Training School at Mingaladon by the Japanese army lead to any
meaningful commitment of these forces on the front, even as the war
turned decisively against the Japanese within Burma. During the final
daring push by the Japanese in the Imphal campaign of the spring of
1944, Burmese Premier Ba Maw claimed to have complained that, while
Indian National Army forces were actively used in the Japanese advance,
the BNA was not given any chance to win glory.[^^[304]^^](#_ftn304)
According to his account, it was recommended that he keep the Burmese
army busy by, "holding parades now and then.”[^^[305]^^](#_ftn305)

With the exception of a few minor battles, the Japanese trained Burmese
National Army did not, then, ever get to truly test itself against the
colonial power it was born to fight. The development of the wartime BIA,
BDA and BNA, did however, have a profound transformative impact on the
development of a Burmese national society. While minority ethnic groups
in the colony widely served in police units under the British, the
Japanese armies drew upon a state and military apparatus of elites who
possessed a broader range of skills.[^^[306]^^](#_ftn306) BIA soldiers
were stationed across the country in villages that had little or no
connection to a national whole, and villagers were exposed to an
emerging national idiom and propaganda of a Burmese or Myanmar
nation.[^^[307]^^](#_ftn307) According to one sample, during its period
of greatest autonomy in the spring of 1942, the BIA appointed three
quarters of the local administrators in district headquarters, with the
remainder appointed by Japanese or composed of local
elders.[^^[308]^^](#_ftn308) Even in the increasingly desperate days of
1944, the army drew in enthusiastic recruits from among village youths
who were provided with clothing and food, as well as access to a
national commodity procurement system that linked cities and countryside
in a new economic network.[^^[309]^^](#_ftn309) Finally, the first
Thirty Comrades who founded the BIA and some of the other officers to
emerge from the Mingaladon training school would form the core of
Burma’s postwar political and military elites.

*The BIA and Ethnic Violence*

These national legacies of a Japanese sponsored military force that was
predominantly made up of ethnic Burman (Bamar) soldiers were marred by
terrible ethnic violence. Atrocities began with the establishment of BIA
military control in areas where other minority groups had long held
sway. With the withdrawal of British troops from the ethnic Karen
(Kayin) dominated southeast of Burma, the newly formed BIA clashed early
and often with armed local Karen forces in the spring of 1942. The
Karen, prized by the British as allies in arms in the Anglo-Burman wars
and later as colonial police, were targeted by the BIA as sympathizers
of the old empire and for refusing to give up arms provided them by the
British.[^^[310]^^](#_ftn310) The military landscape of Burma was
radically transformed not merely because of the arrival of the Japanese
and the departure of the British but because of the expansion in power
of armed ethnic Burmans throughout minority districts. As Robert H.
Taylor has shown in his study of colonial forces in the colony, in 1931
ethnic Burmans made up barely more a tenth of colonial levies despite
composing three quarters of the population.[^^[311]^^](#_ftn311)
Minorities such as the Karen, valued for their “martial” prowess, were
now faced with thousands of Burman soldiers demanding their weapons and
establishing control over their communities. Escalating violence between
BIA and Karen armed forces eventually led in May, 1942 to massacres of
civilians by both sides.[^^[312]^^](#_ftn312) Even a sympathetic former
officer in the later BNA, Maung Maung, was willing to concede that,
“Many of those who took over towns in the name of the B.I.A. had no
knowledge or experience of administration, the result was a serious loss
of reputation for the B.I.A.” The disputes only declined in 1943
following measures taken, depending on which source you believe, by Ba
Maw, by Karen leaders, or by a frustrated Japanese military which
attempted to meet some Karen demands.[^^[313]^^](#_ftn313)

While local acts of violence by military collaborators against
civilians, or collaboration with Japan’s notorious military police may
have sufficed as targets for postwar trials, the powerful ethnic
dimension of the 1942 massacres complicated the issue. After Japanese
surrender, while elements of what was once the BIA was being merged with
the Burmese Army in September 1945, a bitter memorial sent by a group of
Karen leaders to the Secretary of State for India and Burma, Leopold
Amery, reminded the British of the unwavering wartime loyalty of the
Karens and detailed what they had suffered at the hands of Japanese
sponsored forces,

While Burma was under the military administration of the Burma
Independent Army… they branded the Karens as rebels, and persecuted and
tortured them in all possible ways and in certain districts resorted to
wholesale massacre, not even leaving babies, and set the Karen villages
on fire. In Myaungmya District alone, the Official Report reveals that
about 400 villages were set on fire in this way, and more than 1,800
Karens were slaughtered…Karens of the Salween Hill District, Papun,
fared worse. All of the leading men were slaughtered, and their wives
and daughters before being massacred were subjected to a moral
degradation in the presence of their husbands and fathers…At that time
no influential Burmese leader raised his hand and called a halt to such
senseless massacre. Were it not for the timely intervention of the
Nippon Imperial Armies, we could not imagine how far the matter would
have gone.[^^[314]^^](#_ftn314)

The violence between the Burmese dominated military and local Karen
militia would break out again following independence in 1948, and
develop into a full scale Karen uprising in 1949.[^^[315]^^](#_ftn315)
Through the decades of postwar insurgency, the Burmese Army, called the
Tatmadaw, and state propaganda has continued to remind the people of the
“treasonous” Karen collaboration with the British empire. As late as
1984 all brigade commanders and brigadiers of the Karen National
Liberation Army had served in wartime British supported units, as did,
briefly, its main postwar leader until 2004, Saw Bo Mya. For their part,
Karen insurgents have accused the Burmese military of having learnt its
brutal counter-insurgency strategies from Japan.[^^[316]^^](#_ftn316)

In post-independence Burma, the Japanese trained and armed Burma
National Army has not, however, been remembered most for its attempt to
repel its British colonial overlord, as in the case of the Indian
National Army, nor has it mainly been associated with Japanese
atrocities, as were the pro-Japanese Makapili forces in the Philippines.
Instead, in national historical memory, the Burma National Army is known
for the moment it turned against its Japanese maker: the uprising of
March 27, 1945. This national rebellion against the retreating Japanese
forces within Burma was the result of cooperation between Burmese
communists, other resistance organizations and officers of the BNA,
operating with the approval of Aung San and dating back to at least
mid-1944. The coalition of forces coordinated their efforts under the
umbrella of an “Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League” (AFPFL) and
complemented existing BNA armaments with new weapons supplied by Allied
special forces known as Force 136.[^^[317]^^](#_ftn317) At the time of
revolt, the BNA was a modest sized army of around 11,000 but it led the
attack on the Japanese Imperial Army in Rangoon.[^^[318]^^](#_ftn318)
Communist sources claim that forces under the command of the Burmese
Communist Party comprised of around 40,000 and were responsible for
fully half of the Japanese casualties during the uprising, but both in
postwar negotiations with the British and in Burmese commemorations in
the post-independence period, it is the better armed and trained BNA and
Aung San's leadership which has been most
highlighted.[^^[319]^^](#_ftn319)

From the perspective of Allied forces advancing into Burma in the Spring
of 1945, both leading up to the rebellion and in its early aftermath,
responses to military collaboration with Japan, and more broadly, those
who served in any government capacity during the Japanese occupation
ranged from continued hatred of what were considered treasonous subjects
to a more tolerant understanding that acknowledged the strong
nationalist yearnings of “politically active Burmans.” Until Japanese
surrender, however, the British military was not alone in determining
the fate of these forces.

*The Counter-Intelligence Corps in Burma*

While British forces faced off against the Japanese on the borderlands
between Burma and India, tens of thousands of Chinese Nationalist
government soldiers, along with a much smaller number of American
troops, were organized into a Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC). From
the limited gains of 1943 to the final drive across Burma in 1945, the
NCAC comprised the bulk of regular military forces that fought against
the Japanese on the northern Burmese front. These forces served first
under General Joseph Stilwell and, after his recall by President
Roosevelt in October, 1944, Burma based forces were transferred to the
control of General Daniel Sultan. The Chinese forces included both
expeditionary forces from western Yunnan province, joined by units such
as the powerful New 38th Division that had earlier retreated into India
under the command of one of China’s most accomplished wartime
commanders, Sun Liren. The Chinese and American forces contributed in
two important ways to the campaigns in Burma. Their push south permitted
the creation of a new land route from India to China known as the Ledo
Road and, following the completion of the route and until the
dismantlement of NCAC in April, the Chinese troops supported the main
British drive by pursuing retreating Japanese forces south.

This remarkable coordination of US and Chinese military efforts over a
span of several years is remembered mostly for the bitter disagreements
and tensions emerging from the relationship between General Stilwell,
Chiang Kai-shek, and other Chinese commanders.[^^[320]^^](#_ftn320)
Chinese language studies of the challenges of the campaigns in northern
Burma, which also have much to say about Stilwell’s shortcomings, have
benefitted from a strong renewal of interest in this theater of the war
over the past few years.[^^[321]^^](#_ftn321) These works understandably
appreciate the campaigns for the rare contrast they present with the
otherwise frustratingly stagnant Sino-Japanese conflict: an example of
well-trained Chinese divisions capturing large expanses of territory
while pushing back a steadily retreating Japanese foe. Very little is
said or known, however, about the relationship between Chinese forces
and the local populations of northern Burma from 1944 until the transfer
of most Chinese forces back to China in April,
1945.[^^[322]^^](#_ftn322) It is thus difficult to say what Chinese
policy was towards Burmese civilian or military collaborators, referred
to as *mianjian* (緬奸) in Chinese accounts, in areas captured by
Chinese forces. While technically under US command at the strategic
level, their numbers dwarfed those of the Americans and the operational
independence of Chinese units was significant. This partially explains
why Chinese scholarship on the campaigns barely mentions the Americans
when following the day-to-day progress of the campaign. From October,
1944, wherever the Chinese forces advanced in northern Burma, so too did
the United States Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC), which took as one of
its primary missions the apprehension, detention and, in at least some
cases, the execution of Japan’s local collaborators. In New Guinea, the
Philippines, and later in both occupied Japan and Korea, the CIC
operated in unit detachments that functioned relatively independently.
In Burma, they operated as a single unit under the overall command of US
Army military intelligence, G2. Most of the agents were in turn divided
up into five highly mobile interrogation teams (CITs) of two to four
agents joined by interpreters or other locally employed assistants that
followed closely behind the attacking Chinese
troops.[^^[323]^^](#_ftn323)

This small number of CIC interrogation teams moved into recently
captured territory and collected enemy documents for analysis,
identified security threats and suspected spies, but also actively
sought out anyone who was known to have collaborated actively with the
Japanese occupation. It was especially interested in apprehending
collaborators suspected of being indirectly or directly responsible for
violence against Allied troops. To accomplish this, they implemented a
black and white classification system not unlike that employed by the
British military for captured Indian National Army members. Instead of
limiting the classification to military collaborators, however, the CIC
moved into Burmese towns and villages and set about compiling a “white”
and “black” list for the civilian population at large, distinguishing
trustworthy local contacts from enemy collaborators and agents to be
surveilled or arrested.[^^[324]^^](#_ftn324)

The first interrogation team, including Thomas P. Wheeley and Edris Carr
arrested a number of local collaborators with the Japanese in the
Irawaddy port of Htigyaing (Tigyaing), including five Burmese of
unidentified ethnicity who had ferried some British soldiers across a
river, only to betray them to the Japanese upon
arrival.[^^[325]^^](#_ftn325) They also arrested and imprisoned a dozen
women who were members of the nationalist Thakin League, for providing
“aid and comfort” to the Japanese by procuring them supplies. In Moda
Gyi village, not far from the town of Katha, where George Orwell had
once served as a police officer, CIC officers arrested six members of a
Japanese-trained raiding party that had engaged in sabotage, and
collected evidence on another 40 collaborators it had arrested in
February, 1945.[^^[326]^^](#_ftn326) The team also arrested, tried and
executed two locals for the capture and torture of Allied troops,
including one Saung Swe and his subordinate.[^^[327]^^](#_ftn327) The
second interrogation team travelled through rural jungle terrain and
remote villages in search of intelligence as well expand their list of
suspected collaborators.[^^[328]^^](#_ftn328) In Namhkan and Muse, CIC
officers of the third interrogation team arrested 23 suspected
collaborators and left them in jail before moving
on.[^^[329]^^](#_ftn329) The fifth interrogation unit, which included
CIC agents James Lucas, Seymour Abeles, Joe Breechen, and Edmund Fong,
moved together with the Chinese 50th Division. They set up an informant
network as they went along, arrested 25 collaborator suspects in the
span of just two weeks, and, “the local Indian Independence League kept
them very busy.”[^^[330]^^](#_ftn330)

The fourth interrogation team, including agents Newland and Quon,
arrived in Katha shortly after its surrender, but came into direct
conflict with a British Civil Affairs team, also despatched to the town,
over what policy to follow with regards to collaborators. According to
the CIC agent perspective, the British wanted to handle cases of
collaboration under “peacetime regulations,” while the CIC had a
standing policy of imprisoning suspected collaborators until
investigations were completed, which in reality often meant until the
end of the war.[^^[331]^^](#_ftn331) Though, without the British report
on the same interaction, it is hard to tell what exactly transpired, the
American evaluation is probably a mischaracterization of the differences
in approach, given that special British wartime regulations for the
apprehension of security threats had, as we have seen, resulted in
thousands of individuals being detained in India and elsewhere until
well after Japanese surrender.

The operation that finds the most frequent mention in works about CIC
operations in the India-Burma-China theater, and the only one from Burma
to make its way into the official history of Army Counter-Intelligence,
is the capture of Sinwa Nawng, the *Duwa* or headman of the village of
Kansi, about 150km northwest of Myitkyina.[^^[332]^^](#_ftn332) The
Kansi *Duwa* controlled the profitable jade mines in the area and became
a bitter opponent of the British colonial administration following a
disagreement over what proportion of jade profits should be turned over
to the colonial government.[^^[333]^^](#_ftn333) CIC agent Edmund Fong
traveled for two weeks together with one Burmese inspector to reach the
location in order to apprehend this single collaborator, who was
suspected of having captured 15 Burmese soldiers and one Lt. Stewart
Walker, an American pilot, who he handed over to the Japanese military.
On arriving in Kansi, Fong contacted a local Chinese liaison unit which
refused to permit the arrest, insisting that Sinwa Nawng had been
instrumental in securing food and labor for the occupying Chinese
forces. Fong was only able to proceed to Myitkyina with the *Duwa*,
later joined by another three collaborators picked up along the way,
after deceiving their Chinese counterparts.[^^[334]^^](#_ftn334)

The arrest of Kansi *Duwa*Sinwa Nawng is a fairly typical example of the
kind of collaboration case of most interest to US forces. While the
civilian population often bore the brunt of violence in the wartime
occupations of the region, it was not the area of primary focus for CIC
collaborator investigations. Instead, the arrest, torture, or execution
of Allied personnel was of central importance and agents like Edmund
Fong could justify the distances traveled and the deception of allied
Chinese forces in the name arresting a collaborator in some measure
responsible for the execution of a US pilot. In the early postwar
period, when the focus of CIC activities shifted in Burma, as it did
elsewhere, to gathering evidence for postwar war crimes trials,
massacres and torture of the local Burmese population may have been
given greater consideration. Violence or atrocities against civilians
were the focus of more than half of some 40 war crimes trials against
Japanese soldiers in Burma.[^^[335]^^](#_ftn335) For example, the first
Rangoon based war crimes trial, convened in March, 1946 involved a trial
of over a dozen Japanese soldiers for the July, 1945 massacre of over
six hundred civilians in the village of Kalagon.[^^[336]^^](#_ftn336)
However, while these Rangoon prosecutions for B and C category
conventional war crimes may have included Korean and Taiwanese members
of the Japanese armed forces, they did not include Burmese military
collaborators, or local military police auxiliaries who may have been
complicit in crimes against the civilian
population.[^^[337]^^](#_ftn337)

The execution of Saung Swe and his subordinate, as well as occasional
references to the trial and execution of spies in the European theater
in CIC histories shows that it did have the authority to carry out its
own field trials and punish of those it detained. In the Philippines we
shall see that the CIC detained thousands of collaborators until the
conclusion of hostilities and then either released them or turned them
over to the custody of the Philippine judiciary for treason
prosecutions. In Burma, it is likely that any collaborators still under
detention at Japan’s surrender, or even earlier with the winding down of
American operations in northern Burma, were either released or turned
over to the British military administration. We shall see that the
British prosecuted very few of these cases. After the considerable
trouble the CIC went through to apprehend him, the “notorious
collaborator,” the Kansi *Duwa*Sinwa Nawng, reappears in the postwar
period as a candidate in the elections for the Kachin State in 1951,
running against the standing president of the Kachin State who,
confusingly, both bears his same name and was also among the few Kachins
to actively collaborate with the Japanese wartime administration, the
Sima *Duwa* Sinwa Nawng.[^^[338]^^](#_ftn338)

*The Evolving British Response*

 Though British officers complained that its importance was vastly
exaggerated, the uprising of the Burma National Army had a significant
impact on an already weakened Japanese military in
retreat.[^^[339]^^](#_ftn339) It helped prepare the way for the
occupation of Rangoon, harassed the retreat of the Japanese, and robbed
them of any remaining local support. As with the INA and its exaggerated
postwar claims for its importance, however, so too did the Burma
National Army quickly begin to portray itself as the key to Japanese
defeat. General William Slim, who had acknowledged that the BNA had
provided some valuable assistance, grew annoyed with their “extravagant
claims” after Japanese surrender. He protested that the BNA “rendered
considerably more assistance to the Japanese than during the period
after it had seen fit to transfer its allegiance to the
Allies.”[^^[340]^^](#_ftn340) The Burma National Army, renamed a third
time by the Allies as the “Patriotic Burmese Forces,” was reluctantly
permitted to join a 15 June victory parade in
Rangoon.[^^[341]^^](#_ftn341) Thanks to its brief few weeks of service
in the war against the Japanese, the BNA and Aung San, who had until
that uprising displayed brutality towards anti-Japanese insurgents, were
reborn as anti-fascist combatants and set on a rocky path to becoming
legitimate partners in negotiations for Burmese dominion status and
self-rule. The challenges along the way to this transformation from a
treasonous army to a competing source of military power in postwar Burma
that was reluctantly partnered with has sometimes been overlooked.
Christopher A. Bayly, a leading historian of British Empire concluded
that, “In Burma there had never been a question of treating the BNA in
the same manner as the INA, except among the most intransigent old
British civil servants.”

 In fact, there was considerable internal disagreement among the British
military, colonial officials, and cabinet from 1943-1946 on the issue of
how to treat Burmese collaborators in general, and specifically the
Burma National Army, even after it switched sides. In November 1943, the
chief civil affairs officer for Burma, Maj. Gen. Charles F. B. Pearce,
noted that, in addition to section 121 of the Penal Code which provides
for a penalty of death or life sentence, a similar clause in the Defense
of Burma Act provides the same penalty for anyone, “with intent to wage
war against His Majesty, or to assist any state at war with His
Majesty…” Pearce pointed out that, in the year 1943 alone, at least ten
persons had been executed for such treason in the Arakan and Chindwin
areas.[^^[342]^^](#_ftn342) “At any time,” he noted, “we may be faced
with the trial of a large number of persons who are liable to the death
penalty.” Already at this early stage, Pearce warned against the
unsettling effect of any execution of a large number of people, and
recommended that penalty only for those who had been found guilty of,
“brutal behavior and disregard of the ordinary usages of
war.”[^^[343]^^](#_ftn343) Whatever the policy adopted, Pearce
recommended that the functions of judicial tribunals not be interfered
with, but that pardons be considered after harsh sentences. However, “it
will do the Burman no harm,” he concluded, “to undergo a certain amount
of mental anguish on being condemned to death by a tribunal; and public
opinion will react more favorably to clemency if this is exercised after
it has been judicially held that a sentence of death is, from the legal
point of view, sustainable.”[^^[344]^^](#_ftn344) This is not far from
the kind of position the Red Fort prisoners of the INA found themselves
in: on trial for crimes that could have ended in their execution, only
to be released without confirmation of their sentence.

At a meeting in October 1944, the Governor-General of Burma, Sir
Reginald Dorman-Smith, suggested the issue be treated with caution and
only those, “who were guilty of murder or mass cruelty should be
prescribed in the first instance.”[^^[345]^^](#_ftn345) He expressed
concern that Burmese officials needed for the regular functioning of
local administrations would flee, fearing retribution for their wartime
conduct. Specifically, he pointed to the example of local functionaries
in Myitkyina, “who all disappeared when the Allies captured the
town.”[^^[346]^^](#_ftn346) Myitkyina was an unusual city to choose as
an example. British forces were not significantly involved in the
capture of the city from Japanese control in August, 1944. The city fell
only after three months of prolonged siege by tens of thousands of
Chinese soldiers and the American special operations unit known as
Merrill’s Maurauders. Burmese officials probably had as much to fear
from Allied artillery as from retribution following capture. If they did
fear retribution for collaboration, however, their most immediate
concern was potential arrest by the United States Counter-intelligence
Corps interrogation teams, or possibly, their Chinese equivalents, who
had suffered heavy casualties against fierce Japanese resistance.

In December, 1944 a draft policy on collaboration in Burma was drawn
based on a general principle of, “a generous and tolerant view of their
conduct.”[^^[347]^^](#_ftn347) This remarkable draft called for trials
only for serious crimes and, in the case of civilian leaders of Japan's
Burmese client state,

No grudges born against those leaders who simply chose the illusory
freedom; on the contrary it is to be hoped that they will have gained
from their experiences under Japanese rule a perspective which will
equip them to serve their country better in future.[^^[348]^^](#_ftn348)

 According to the draft, in contrast to these collaborators in the civil
administration, the personnel of the Burma National Army were to be
denied Prisoner of War status and were liable for prosecution under
either section 121 of the Penal Code (waging war against His Majesty) or
the corresponding section of the Defense of Burma Act, though with an
emphasis on the above-mentioned general principle of
tolerance.[^^[349]^^](#_ftn349)

 When the BNA rose up in revolt on March 27, 1945, there was no
immediate reversal of British positions on the potential prosecution of
Burma National Army members for treason. Even the figure who later would
show the greatest leniency in matters regarding trials for collaborators
from India to Malaya, Supreme Commander South East Asia Command Admiral
Louis Mountbatten, still called for those with “charges outstanding” to
stand trial at the close of the war. He stood “entirely opposed” to any
general amnesty being granted to the BNA and that they, “be told that
their present actions were appreciated but that their past offenses have
not been forgotten…”[^^[350]^^](#_ftn350) Gradually, however, the more
vague language of serious crimes and treason in general was replaced by
discussions that focused on specific acts of illegitimate violence. By
April, Mountbatten was suggesting that a new law be drafted to cope with
those Burmese guilty of torture and other atrocities in connection with
the Japanese occupation worded in such a way that it avoided,
“introducing a political flavor into a criminal
offense.”[^^[351]^^](#_ftn351) The work had begun of walling off more
egregious cases of atrocities by collaborators from simple acts of
treason or war against His Majesty.

To accomplish this task, in May 1945, the Chiefs of Staff directed
Mountbatten to initially make use of the Burma National Army, “as you
will,” in fighting the Japanese but thereafter gather them in holding
centers, and assign police to investigate
atrocities.[^^[352]^^](#_ftn352) The Deputy Chief of Staff for
Information and Civil Affairs in Kandy recommended placing Aung San
under house arrest and dividing the BNA (now the Patriotic Burmese
Forces) troops into Whites, Grays and Blacks in the same way that the
soldiers of Indian National Army were.[^^[353]^^](#_ftn353) While
Mountbatten agreed in principle to the idea of sorting through the BNA,
he suggested it was not possible to peacefully collect 10,000 armed
Burmese into holding centers or to secure the cooperation of their
leader, Aung San.[^^[354]^^](#_ftn354) The issue of organized
interrogations of all these “patriotic” troops was thereafter dropped in
debates throughout the summer of 1945. Instead the summer was spent
determining exactly whether and how some of the members of the Patriotic
Burmese Forces could be incorporated into a new Burmese
army.[^^[355]^^](#_ftn355) When Mountbatten first approached Aung San
about the possibility of individual trials for atrocities, Aung San and
other officers present seemed to accept the fact that no general amnesty
could be offered, and is recorded as responding,

“I understand this, but must point out that the people against whom you
are most likely to have charges are my best officers and NCOs, and if
they are suddenly removed it may interfere with your own operations, in
which they are helping. Will you therefore please give me a few days’
notice in each case, so that I may endeavor to send up adequate reliefs
to take their place.”[^^[356]^^](#_ftn356)

 The India and Burma committee seemed to rule finally on the issue in
October 20, 1945, eliminating the question of acts of simple treason
once and for all and leaving only the question of atrocities. “The
question of the treatment to be accorded to Aung San and those who under
him collaborated militarily with the Japanese has been largely prejudged
by the treatment which has latterly been accorded to them…this
recognition of these irregular and formerly hostile forces may seem to
make it difficult to charge any of them with crimes against the state,
though of course they are still open to charges of ordinary crimes of
violence…”[^^[357]^^](#_ftn357) Two days later, Burma Governor
Dorman-Smith also agreed that the treatment of Aung San and his forces
meant that only non-political crimes of a criminal character should be
investigated going forward.[^^[358]^^](#_ftn358)

It was only at this time that the state of affairs in Burma and India
truly diverged. As the committee in Burma was recognizing that the issue
had been “prejudged by the treatment” of the BNA after March, 1945, one
could have argued that there was a similar “prejudgment” in the
treatment of thousands of Indian National Army members that had been
classified Whites, Grays, or even Dark Grays before May, 1945, and that
had then “recovered” from their treason and returned to the ranks of the
Indian Army. But at the very moment in October, 1945 when Burmese
colonial officials had essentially tossed out the crime of treason in
favor of other simpler crimes of violence, British officials in India
were estimating that the large number of court-martials it was planning
would result in something around 50 death sentences. At the same time,
the cabinet in England was being cautioned that a failure to punish
those who broke their allegiance was an invitation to subversion. The
debate amongst British officials on Burmese collaboration had moved from
1) considering leniency toward civil administrators but conducting some
treason trials against military collaborators to 2) considering the
interrogation of all Burma National Army, now PBF, troops to expose
atrocities, to 3) selected individual investigations, and finally a 4)
passive recognition of individual criminal accusations brought against
members of the PBF.

These developments did not take place without some self-doubt. In India
this primarily took the form of concern about justice for the “loyal
Indian POW” who suffered while those who volunteered for the Indian
National Army “cowardly” left the camp to serve their new Japanese
masters. In the case of Burma, the equivalent of the loyal Indian POW
was found in the various minority groups such as the Karens and Kachins
that, for the most part, supported Allied guerrilla efforts. The
forgiving policy towards the PBF may, warned a paper prepared for the
cabinet, “provoke some dissatisfaction” with these
groups.[^^[359]^^](#_ftn359) This dissatisfaction was particularly
strong among the Karens who suffered the most at the hands of Japanese
military collaborators. They made their position clear in a petition
submitted to the Governor the following spring, “The Karens stood
loyally by the British. In Europe, it is found that such traitors are
punished and friends rewarded. The opposite happened in
Burma…”[^^[360]^^](#_ftn360)

*An Inconvenient Murder*

 The progress of ever narrowing possibilities for judicial action
against the PBF may have been settled at this point and allowed a
limited number of cases involving torture or other atrocities to go
forward. But new policy faced the challenge of an awkward murder case
that came to light in the following month, November 1945, only days
after the trial of Indian National Army officers on a combination of
treason and murder charges commenced in Delhi. Lieutenant General G. W.
Symes delivered a document to the Governor of Burma Reginald
Dorman-Smith containing testimony offered by six Indians that, while
commanding the Burma Independence Army in 1942, Aung San had murdered a
British appointed village headman, Abdul Rauf, by his own
hand.[^^[361]^^](#_ftn361) In the momentous INA trails just then under
way in Delhi, the British had chosen three men accused of the murder of
one of their own fellow INA soldiers executed for desertion. This was
their first selected example of INA brutality that was designed to shock
the nation; a crime that was to dissolve the sympathy of nationalists
around the subcontinent. Yet here in Burma, at that same moment, was a
case of the brutal murder of a loyal Indian civilian administrator in
British employ, surely more serious than a case of collaborators
murdering fellow collaborators. Mountbatten, however, expressed little
concern, “this appears to have occurred during the period immediately
following our retreat; in the heat of the moment, and in the unsettled
conditions which must have existed, it was only to be expected, I
suppose, that summary justice would rule, and that old scores would be
paid off.”[^^[362]^^](#_ftn362)

 The India and Burma committee of the Cabinet took up the issue the
following day, November 19, admitting that, “this discovery raised an
awkward dilemma,” that there was, “a risk of the prosecution being
misrepresented as political persecution,” and suggested to forestall the
issue by giving Aung San a chance to clear his
name.[^^[363]^^](#_ftn363) News of the accusation was not public and no
action was taken until, only a few days after the first war crimes trial
against Japanese soldiers began in March, the allegation against Aung
San was made public by another witness to the murder: one of Aung San’s
fellow “Thirty Comrades,” and a political officer attached to the Burma
National Army, Tun Oke, who had just been appointed Minister of Planning
by the British.[^^[364]^^](#_ftn364)

With this revelation, “there can be no question of closing our ears,”
admitted Arthur Henderson, Under-Secretary of State for Burma and India
in a report to the British Prime Minister Attlee. The Governor
Dorman-Smith recommended that a full investigation be carried out and
that Aung San be detained after the first anniversary of the March
uprising.[^^[365]^^](#_ftn365) The embarrassment caused by the case was
compounded by the discovery that the accuser Tun Oke had published a
wartime memoir My Struggle—the title was a translation from Hitler's own
work—which implicated him in the decapitation and impaling upon a stake
of three dead British soldiers, and an order for the execution of almost
a dozen British prisoners of war.[^^[366]^^](#_ftn366) Concerned that
playing up the atrocities mentioned in the memoir might bring forward
counter-allegations about the cruelty of British rule in Burma, Governor
Dorman-Smith warned Secretary of State Amery, “Please do not attempt to
deny that we did cut off the heads of Burmese rebels during the last
rebellion [of 1931]. We did, and Burma has not forgotten this. It is
true that we brought in the heads of Burmans killed in action for
purposes of identification. But a head is a head for all
that.”[^^[367]^^](#_ftn367)

The public allegation of murder by Tun Oke sparked over three months of
debate about how to proceed. Perhaps regretting his call, almost exactly
one year earlier, to remind the Burma National Army that its “past
offenses have not been forgotten” Mountbatten defended Aung San, “I
should have thought our best policy would have been to forget incidents
of this sort,” and argued an arrest would be, “the greatest disservice”
to future relations with Burma.[^^[368]^^](#_ftn368) A meeting of
leading Burma colonial officials on the anniversary of the rebellion
March 27, 1946 was held, including military and police officials
specifically to exchange opinions on the consequences of any arrest of
Aung San. Deputy Governor John Wise noted that others had already been
hanged for similar offenses going back to 1942, and thought it
“deplorable” that Aung San’s status would exempt
him.[^^[369]^^](#_ftn369) Unfortunately, the British were anything but
consistent in dealing with such atrocities. Even before the BNA
uprising, Major-General Pearce had granted amnesty to six hundred
guerrillas working with Force 136 in Arakan, some of whom were about to
be executed for the murder of Muslims and for collaboration with the
Japanese in 1942.[^^[370]^^](#_ftn370) In the case of Aung San, far more
was at risk, and both Lieutenant General H. R. Briggs and G. Chettle, a
police official, warned of serious consequences in their comments at the
March meeting. The same day, in a letter to the Governor-General the
Director of Public Relations George Appleton warned that arresting Aung
San would “have results comparable to those of the INA trials in
India.”[^^[371]^^](#_ftn371)

Things only got worse the following month. Aung San publicly admitted
executing the headman in a speech on April 7 but claimed that the
executed headman was, “a wicked person who ill treated his
villagers…”[^^[372]^^](#_ftn372) The following day the wife of the
headman submitted a formal petition requesting the punishment of Aung
San for her husband’s death. In it she claimed her muslim husband,
headman of Thebyugone Village in Thaton District, had served the British
faithfully and had actively suppressed uprisings in his jurisdiction.
She claimed that before his execution, her husband was insulted by the
putting of a pig in the cart which transported him as a prisoner to
Thaton. There he was starved for eight days and finally bayoneted by
Aung San in a stadium after crucifixion to a
goalpost.[^^[373]^^](#_ftn373)

In April, the changeable Governor Dorman-Smith agreed that they must
“finally reject” the idea of arresting Aung San because of the dangers
involved after the pessimistic security briefing on March 27. He soon
reversed himself once again to support Aung San’s prosecution and the
need to face any unrest that might follow it. In the face of strong
opposition from the Indian colonial government to the arrest and any use
of the Indian Army to suppress opposition, the Governor began to plan
the deployment of his few non-Indian troops to deal with the expected
violence.[^^[374]^^](#_ftn374) Not to act upon the petition, argued
Dorman-Smith was to “impugn law and bring it into
contempt.”[^^[375]^^](#_ftn375) In May, however, acting on Indian
opposition, the London cabinet ordered an “embargo” on action against
Aung San until final agreement could be made on how best to
proceed.[^^[376]^^](#_ftn376) The Governor-General began to waver once
again. In a letter to Prime Minister Attlee he echoed a claim made by
Aung San that his case would reopen the issue of wartime atrocities, and
“once we begin to deal with complaints…people will feel encouraged to
work off old scores.”[^^[377]^^](#_ftn377) Perhaps, he mused, there was
no course but to declare an amnesty for crimes during the occupation.
After Aung San stopped by for a “heart to heart talk” in the last days
of his Governorship, Dorman-Smith wondered, “whether police could not
just say that their investigations show there is so much doubt attached
to the case they do not wish to pursue it.”[^^[378]^^](#_ftn378)

During this flurry of exchanges between the cabinet, the colonial
government of India and Governor Dorman-Smith, the Aung San murder case
should have been moving slowly through the legal system from police
investigation to indictment. In fact, these steps in preparation for any
final arrest were not taken. According to an account by Frank Donnison,
the widow’s petition for justice, “reposed” untouched in his safe until
Donnison transferred it to Government House as a sensitive matter to be
dealt with by the Governor at “his discretion.”[^^[379]^^](#_ftn379)
Even without action, however, the case still hung like a shadow over
negotiations with the leaders of the March rebellion and in debates over
the composition of a new Executive Council for Burma.

Having lost the confidence of the prime minister, not the least for his
vacillating tendencies, Dorman-Smith was dismissed as Governor and
returned to England. Henry Knight, an experienced colonial official with
wide support, was appointed as acting Governor in his place. Knight felt
that prosecuting Aung San was like, evoking a biblical metaphor,
“straining at a gnat.”[^^[380]^^](#_ftn380) If this was true, however,
it was only because the British had already “swallowed the camel” that
was the Burma National Army. The “beautiful outward,” as the New
Testament verse continued, was, “within full of dead men’s bones, and of
all uncleanness.”[^^[381]^^](#_ftn381)

It would be Knight, who only served as acting Governor from June to
August 1946, who would finally settle the issue of Aung San’s murder
case in a single stroke. He drew up an act, “primarily to prevent Aung
San and Let Ya cases coming into court without my special sanction,”
entitled “The Sanction for Prosecution (War-times Offences) Act,
1946.”[^^[382]^^](#_ftn382) It required the Governor’s sanction before
any court accepted a criminal case involving offenses committed from
December 8, 1941 to May 5, 1945. This was not an amnesty; the former BNA
soldiers and their leaders were not explicitly “forgiven” in any legal
sense for either their treason or wartime atrocities. Instead, Knight
chose a unique approach that produced the same results without the
distasteful responsibility associated with an amnesty: the creation of a
legal black hole. Petitions for cases might be submitted, police
investigations carried out, but no trials would result.

The War-time Offenses Act was created to address the awkward case of
Aung San and some of his fellow commanders. However, it also effectively
decided the question of how to deal with wartime collaboration as well
as wartime atrocities across the board. Although the Governor could
still allow cases to go forward, the progress of all prosecutions could
now be decided solely on political expediency, rather than upon their
legal merit.

The influence of the Aung San murder case was felt all the way down to
the local level, as can be seen in an account by the Deputy Commissioner
at Mergui in southern Burma, Maurice Maybury. After his return to the
colony, a number of collaborators were jailed and some investigated for
atrocities in his district. One of them was accused of taking part in a
public execution. A random victim had been selected, tied to a post and
the execution was carried out by a number of Burmese thakins and
Japanese soldiers.

Our man had been one of those taking part in the bayonetting. The
evidence against him was overwhelming and we were sure that when the
case came to trial the conviction was inevitable. While the case against
him was being prepared, however, orders were received from Rangoon that
the charge of murder was not to be preferred… and lesser charges were
preferred of which he was subsequently found guilty. It was not until
some time afterwards that we discovered the reason for the apparently
inexplicable orders of the government not to proceed with the case. It
was because such a prosecution in such a case would’ve created an
unfortunate precedent which might well have led to similar charges being
preferred against Bogyoke Aung San…[^^[383]^^](#_ftn383)

Frank Donnison, who had guarded over the petition against Aung San in
his safe, offers further confirmation in his history of the British
Military Administration. According to Donnison, none of the special
tribunals that had been planned for hearing collaboration cases in Burma
were ever convened. Given the treatment shown Aung San, offiicals
recognized that, “there could be no justice in proceeding against
others,” and the issue was, “quietly allowed to sink out of
sight.”[^^[384]^^](#_ftn384)

 The early postwar debates among British officials over how to deal with
the treason and atrocities of military collaborators with the Japanese
were ultimately settled by the political reality the empire faced in
1945. In Burma, the peeling away of the collaboration problem to leave a
core of punishable “turncoats who happened to be brutes,” was ultimately
not enough to settle matters, even without including the highly
political crime of treason. One turncoat, accused of murder, was too
valuable to lose. The 1946 law created to save him ended attempts to try
other Burmese collaborators accused of atrocities, even as prosecutions
of Japanese soldiers for similar crimes proceeded throughout the year.
Though his popularity was in decline, Aung San wielded the threat of an
armed uprising against the weakened British Empire effectively until his
assassination in 1947, while offering at the same time the prospect that
he could serve as a moderating influence upon the Communists within his
increasingly fractured political alliance, the Anti-Fascist People's
Freedom League (AFPFL). Aung San was also seen as the leader of
sufficient stature to help negotiate a power arrangement between the
many ethnic groups of the colony.[^^[385]^^](#_ftn385) For decades after
his death he would be remembered as the ultimate military and even
spiritual leader of the modern Burmese nation and the founder of the
Burmese army. During the protests of 1988 Aung San would once again
become an awkward thorn in the side of the government from beyond the
grave, but this time for his wartime comrade Ne Win. During the
protests, Aung San’s daughter Aung San Suu Kyi began to invoke the
memory of her father in the cause of democratic opposition to the Ne Win
dictatorship.[^^[386]^^](#_ftn386)

 If the British colonial government had proceeded with trials for crimes
committed during the Japanese occupation without attempting to attach it
to the political crime of treason, it still would have had to overcome
many challenges. Prosecutors for special tribunals would be faced with
complex cases of inter-ethnic violence that represented the most
significant acts of wartime atrocities. As negotiations were underway to
create a single Burmese federation that included several autonomous
states, both British and various representatives of Burmese groups were
eager to avoid anything which might contribute to instability. It is
possible that trying ethnic Burmans, for example, for wartime crimes
against Karen villages, might have increased confidence among Karens in
the sincerity of any newly formed regime, but how would they have
reacted to trials of their own number who engaged in similar acts? How
were acts carried out by native guerrillas acting on behalf of the
Allies to be dealt with?

Beyond the ethnic dimension, two contending “red” and “white” Communist
factions operating outside and within the AFPFL were eager to take
advantage of any perceived weakness by Aung San and other non-Communist
AFPFL leaders in the face of British demands. Trials for wartime crimes
would offer Communists two tempting political options. They could oppose
the trials as another example of imperialism at work, or perhaps more
dangerously, embrace them in the hope that non-Communist leaders of the
AFPFL were at greatest risk of prosecution. Even without the unknown
impact of the trials, the crippled British administration was already
overwhelmed. However, despite all the worrying signs, in 1946, the
British colonial administration still held out some hope for peace in a
post-colonial Burma, even if almost all of Burma’s leading politicians
were potential candidates for a treason trial only months before. Its
highest priority was in leaving behind an administration with enough
credibility and broad appeal that it could overcome some the many ethnic
as well as political divisions that loomed. When he stepped down,
Governor Knight invited Aung San, Ba Maw, U Saw, and Ba Sein—all
nationalists who had turned to Japan during the war—over for his
farewell party. “If they’ll come,” he mused, “I should like to regard it
as a good omen for the future!!”[^^[387]^^](#_ftn387)

\

**Part II: Trying Atrocity as Treason in the Philippines**

\

There was another case in which a postwar regime attempted to limit
prosecutions of treason to military collaborators and try wartime
atrocities under the laws of betrayal: the Philippines. As with Burma
and India, the Philippines was a colony that was promised liberation by
Japan. In the fall of 1943, Burma and the Philippines were both granted
their independence, if in name only, and the Provisional Government of
Free India of Subhas Chandra Bose was founded a few weeks later. In the
two years up to the declaration of a new independent republic in the
occupied archipelago, however, the explicit U.S. promise of Philippine
independence in the 1934 Tydings-McDuffie Act and what David Joel
Steinberg has called the, “self-liquidating quality of the American
colonial venture” made Japanese promises of freedom from Western
imperial oppression a less intoxicating prospect.[^^[388]^^](#_ftn388)
Despite this fact, within days of its occupation of Manila, the Japanese
military administration was able to assemble an executive commission
supporting the military administration composed almost entirely of
well-respected prewar oligarchs.

Within three years of Japanese defeat the newly independent Philippine
government would grant all political collaborators amnesty in accordance
with the “overwhelming sentiment of the people”—the focus of the
following chapter, and continue treason prosecutions only for military
collaborators or those who had committed violent crimes, “for the
purpose of aiding and abetting the enemy,” which we will consider in a
separate chapter.[^^[389]^^](#_ftn389) Were it not for the explicit
exclusion of military collaborators, the actual course of political
retribution in the Philippines might have led to a similar outcome, if
by different means, as the process in postwar South Korea, after an
American military government there was replaced by a new independent
republic. In the southern Korean republic a special commission set up to
investigate crimes of collaboration was completely stripped of its teeth
in the summer of 1949. In both the republics of South Korea and the
Philippines the failure of the process ensured strong continuities
across the 1945 divide, preserving the existing elite domination of
politics and administration into the postwar
decades.[^^[390]^^](#_ftn390) In both cases, the issue of collaboration
was a powerful weapon in the hands of the political opposition:
populist, leftist and communist inspired political movements lost no
opportunity to describe the halls of government as a den of traitors.
However, what the Philippines lacked in duration of occupation in
comparison to Japanese colonial rule in Korea, it more than made up in
terms of the scale of devastation, massacres, and rape by Japanese
forces and its local collaborators after it expelled the United States
from the archipelago. Indeed, perhaps the most important difference
between the two was that the Republic of Korea set out to try those who
*collaborated* with its former colonial master, while the Philippines
was trying collaborators who had *betrayed* its former colonial master,
since the treasonous acts were, at their moment of commission, a
violation of allegiance to the “United States *and*the Philippine
Commonwealth.” The treason law itself was virtually identical to the
American one enshrined in its prewar penal code rather than the product,
as in the Korean case, of highly contested postwar legislation, and its
treason trials cited American precedents as often as it did those from
the Philippines.

In the Philippine trials, however, we do not find a colonial power
desperate to make some last demonstration about the costs of disloyalty
within its military, as in India, or come to terms with an awkward new
collaborationist ally without completely ignoring its crimes in war, as
in Burma. Though it proceeded immediately to try Japanese war criminals
in military tribunals on Philippine soil, the U.S. Forces handed over
suspected collaborators to the new Philippine republic within days of
its independence in 1946 without trying any of them. Nor did politicians
and accused collaborators who led the call for amnesty in Manila build
their arguments upon a foundation of postcolonial angst.

The Philippine discourse of patriotic collaboration was thus unlike any
other case in Southeast Asia: the elites who served during the
occupation were not heroes because they fought for freedom and
independence, but because they quietly subverted tyranny. In this
respect, political retribution in the Philippines was unique among the
Western colonies occupied by Japan. Instead, the discourse on treason in
the courts and legislature of the Philippines would be remarkably
familiar to anyone following the same issue in China, France, Greece, or
in more than a dozen other countries. Historical works in the postwar
decades addressing collaboration in the Philippines almost invariably
emphasize the complexities of loyalties under colonial rule to explain
the logic of collaboration and to be sure, in wartime propaganda the
legacy of American colonial rule was ceaselessly condemned, but in the
early aftermath of the war the leading political collaborators rarely
deployed this defense. Instead they arguing they had served as a shield
for the people in a time of war. As the three Filipino judges in the
very first treason case of the newly established People’s Court noted
when confronting the shield defense in their ruling, “Suffice it to say
that Petain, Laval and Quisling, and no lesser figures from many lands,
have all repeated the catchy selfsame plea.”[^^[391]^^](#_ftn391)

Political retribution against collaborators in the Philippines did
share, however, one central feature with the processes we have examined
in the Indian and Burmese cases: here too the problem of collaboration
was dealt with by reducing consideration only to military collaborators
and those responsible for atrocities. In the Philippines the outcome of
this process yielded more stabilizing results at the political level, as
a limited 1948 amnesty for the elites who held wartime positions or who
were leaders of the occupation war economy for the most part averted
serious political unrest. In the following chapter we will examine the
debates over the amnesty and find that, while support for leniency was
sufficient to ensure an overwhelming vote of support for the
presidential decree, there was also considerable discomfort about its
scope. The exclusion from the amnesty of thousands of cases of accused
military collaborators and those guilty of atrocities was contested by
legislators who pointed out its contradictions and the social injustice
it represented. The exceptions were ultimately justified by emphasizing
the undeniable horrors of the violence committed by the perpetrators
but, as the trials themselves would show, treason prosecutions were a
deeply flawed vehicle for confronting the atrocities of war.

\

**Chapter 5: Military Collaboration and the 1948****Amnesty**

*A Geography of Treason*

The Philippines has fully rehabilitated the reputations of its leading
wartime collaborators with Japan. Elsewhere around the world after World
War II, it was rare for the “shield” defense—in which collaborators
claim that they protected the people against even worse repression by
the occupier, or the “double game” defense—the claim to be feigning
collaboration while in fact working for the resistance, achieve the
resounding success won by elite collaborators of the Philippines.
Perhaps the most visible sign of this came in 2010, when the presidency
fell to Benigno Aquino III. Aquino’s grandfather, of the same name, was
Speaker of the National Assembly under the Japanese occupation, a vocal
opponent of the resistance movement, and leader of the Japanese
sponsored wartime political party, the Kalibapi.[^^[392]^^](#_ftn392)

The literal geography of political power in the Philippines today is
marked by leaders who served under the Japanese occupation from 1942 to
1945. In Manila, the street in front of Aquino’s Malacañang Palace is
named after the president of the Japanese occupation’s “independent”
republic declared in 1943: Jose P. Laurel. Mere steps away, the long
Claro M. Recto Avenue is named after one of the leading 20^th^ century
legal minds in the Philippines but one who, in his capacity as wartime
foreign minister, called for victory in Japan’s effort to establish its
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in speech after
speech.[^^[393]^^](#_ftn393) These two men, both former Supreme Court
judges before the war, were tried for treason after Japanese defeat.
Recto would rise enthusiastically to the occasion, presenting the
Supreme Court with the most eloquent and legally formidable, if
unsuccessful, defense of the wartime collaborators in the Philippines in
*Laurel vs. Misa*.[^^[394]^^](#_ftn394) Already well respected before
the war, both men would go on to long postwar political careers and runs
for the presidency. Laurel gained over a third of the national vote in
the violently contested 1949 election and Recto made his own attempt in
1957 with running mate Lorenzo Tañada, the very former Solicitor General
who led treason prosecutions against the leading political collaborators
and whose assistant Solicitor General successfully argued against Recto
in the 1947 *Laurel vs. Misa* case. Even the two volumes of the most
frequently cited history of the Japanese occupation of the archipelago,
published in 1965, were dedicated to the memory of these two men: the
first volume to Laurel, and the second to Recto.[^^[395]^^](#_ftn395)

In Manila, Recto’s avenue cuts from east to west across the city center,
intersecting the north to south roads of three other towering historical
figures, Quezon Boulevard, Rizal Avenue, and Ferdinand E. Marcos
Highway.[^^[396]^^](#_ftn396) More awkwardly, it also intersects a
smaller street named after another former supreme court justice, Jose
Abad Santos. Santos was executed by the Japanese forces in 1942 after he
refused to serve the occupation regime.[^^[397]^^](#_ftn397) In early
postwar Philippines, the name of Santos was raised time and again by
both critics and supporters of the wartime
collaborators.[^^[398]^^](#_ftn398) For the former, his bold refusal to
serve the Japanese contrasted with the cowardice of the
traitors.[^^[399]^^](#_ftn399) For the latter, his death was definitive
proof of the state of duress in which so many chose to accept their
positions under Japanese military rule.

On the large island of Mindanao in the south, a city of half a million
people, General Santos City, is itself named after Paulino Santos, an
officer who rose to the position of Chief of Staff in the Philippine
Army before the war, but one who would end his career as director of the
wartime Constabulary, a position he assumed just in time for its
Commander in Chief, President Laurel, to declare that a state of war
existed between the Philippines and the United States. In nearby Davao,
the second largest city in the Philippines, another Claro M. Recto
Avenue cuts across the heart of the city and continues north,
appropriately enough, under the new name J. P. Laurel Avenue when the
former meets Elpidio Quirino Avenue near the city center. Quirino was
the two term postwar president of the Philippines who defeated the
rehabilitated Jose P. Laurel in the 1949 election. During the election
campaign it had been difficult for Quirino to attack Laurel for his
wartime career for, as Recto noted at the time, when he tried to, “raise
the dead issue of collaboration,” he was, “frightened when he recognized
his own face in the apparition.”[^^[400]^^](#_ftn400) Quirino was among
the first to attempt to cripple the power of a People's Court to try
collaborators after the war perhaps partly because, during the war, in
January 1942, his name came just before Laurel on the long list of
Filipino elites who swore obedience to the Japanese occupation
authorities in what Recto himself referred to as the “Magna Carta of
Treason.[^^[401]^^](#_ftn401)” Quirino served less than enthusiastically
as a member of a wartime Council of State, led by Jorge B. Vargas, which
was the leading advisory body of the Japanese Military Administration
before Laurel’s occupied republic was established in
1943.[^^[402]^^](#_ftn402) In 1944 Quirino helped organize the first
anniversary celebrations of the independence granted to the Philippines
by its Japanese occupier. During the event, which took place a week
before Douglas MacArthur announced his triumphant return to the
Philippines as he stepped onto a beach in Leyte, Recto was granted a
decoration from the Japanese emperor as First Order of Merit with Grand
Cordon of the Rising Sun, joining the other leading wartime leaders
Laurel, Vargas, and Aquino as a recipient of the
honor.[^^[403]^^](#_ftn403) In Davao today, the three streets named
after Laurel, Recto, and Quirino are only outmatched in location by the
wide Roxas Ave, named after the early postwar President Manuel Roxas.
After briefly serving in Laurel’s wartime cabinet, Roxas was given the
full protection of his friend and prewar commanding officer Douglas
MacArthur. As the cynical Brigadier General Elliot R. Thorpe, the
Counter-Intelligence Corps commander who MacArthur asked to take charge
of the Philippine collaboration issue in 1945, put it,

In all the files on enemy collaborators, there was none more interesting
than that of Manuel Roxas…The file on Roxas was a fascinating story of
how to play both ends against the middle and win first prize. Throughout
the period of enemy control of the islands, this smooth talking
politician made it clear to the Japs that if there was one group of
people he really admired they were it. At the same time he took great
care to keep in touch with a few Filipino and American guerrillas,
sending words of encouragement and good wishes.”[^^[404]^^](#_ftn404)

After winning the Presidency and carefully gauging public and American
opinion, Roxas granted amnesty to his wartime colleagues in 1948, thus
bringing to a close their ordeal and freeing them to re-launch their
political careers in earnest.

With a few notable exceptions, the historiography on collaboration in
the Philippines is marked by an admiration and sympathy for the plight
of these elite collaborators. Theirs’ was an unhappy lot, the refrain
goes, who were ordered to stay behind and protect the people by the
retreating President Quezon. Bearing this heavy burden, they were able
to persevere in their awkward and dangerous positions in the Japanese
sponsored regimes only thanks to their unbounded patriotism; desperately
trying to thwart the occupier from within the regime while preserving
national unity and furthering the cause of the people. Each of them
offered evidence of their true loyalties. For Laurel, it was his efforts
to delay a declaration of war on the Allies and even more his refusal to
permit the conscription of Filipino soldiers. This is not to be
underestimated. As Pacita Pestaño-Jacinto, whose diary contained plenty
of criticism for wartime political collaborators, commented in her
description of the President’s speech on the issue of conscription, “For
this Laurel has made himself a hero in the eyes of his
countrymen.”[^^[405]^^](#_ftn405) For Recto, it was his June 1944
memorial, which he claimed to have sent to the Japanese Ambassador
Murata and Lieutenant-General Wachi.[^^[406]^^](#_ftn406) In the letter,
copies of which circulated widely, he condemned in great detail the
failures and hypocrisy of the occupation. Quirino was briefly imprisoned
as a guerrilla suspect, and his brief service in the wartime republic
was not enough to save his wife and three of this children from death at
the hands of Japanese soldiers during the liberation of Manila in
1945.[^^[407]^^](#_ftn407) Paulino Santos was thought to be more
enthusiastic about the Japanese cause but is better remembered for
having clashed with the Japanese military police in order to prevent the
death of many civilians.[^^[408]^^](#_ftn408) For Roxas, there were the
stories of self-induced fever to delay accepting any position in the
puppet government, and the role he played as a link between Laurel and
agents of the resistance was attested to by many.[^^[409]^^](#_ftn409)

Absolutely key to their “shield” defense, however, was their ability to
point to a more ominous evil that lurked in the wings, prepared to
assume power the moment these collaborators failed in their double game.
These were the “genuine pro-Japanese” traitors, the allies of the two
famous revolutionaries Benigno Ramos and Artemio Ricarte. These two had
turned to Japan for help in ridding the Philippines of its American
overlord long before the war and their followers were seen as sycophants
ready to carry out the violent bidding of the
occupier.[^^[410]^^](#_ftn410) Only they, it was suggested, were truly
willing to wage war on the resistance and thus pitch Filipino against
Filipino in a violent civil war. Their moment would finally come in late
1944, after U.S. forces had already landed and begun to retake the
archipelago.

In November, Philippine military collaboration with the Japanese would
commence in earnest, suggests the standard narrative, especially
following the creation of a military organization known as the Makapili.
But this neat account is indeed too neat. While Ramos has been
“dismissed contemptuously” by historians such as Teodoro Agoncillo,
thanks in part to his “delirious admiration for the Japanese,” Ricarte,
whose collaboration “was based on historical grounds,” would soon be
restored to a position as the nationalist hero of the
American-Philippine war, who had fought bravely against the United
States until his capture in 1900.[^^[411]^^](#_ftn411) In 1969, by order
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the house Artemio
Ricarte was born in was transformed into a “national shrine,” awarding
it a status also held by Fort Santiago, Japan's wartime military police
headquarters and the most feared home of torture and execution during
the Japanese occupation.[^^[412]^^](#_ftn412) When the Philippine
legislature debated the presidential amnesty in 1948 it was the contrast
between the collaboration of the occupation’s governing elite and the
informers and military collaborators that dominated the discussion. Let
us examine these mostly reviled wartime figures in closer detail.

*Military Collaboration in the Philippines***

 The organized Japanese use of armed Filipinos in counterinsurgency
efforts did not begin right away. It came in two very distinct stages,
the first after the stabilization of the occupation in 1942 and the
second following the return of American forces to the archipelago in
1944. Japanese efforts to recruit military collaborators in the
Philippines lacked consistency in policy and commitment of resources. In
these regards it joined the chaotic efforts to find military allies
across the domains occupied by the empire. The training of large numbers
of Burmese and Indian troops began almost immediately in 1942 as Japan
moved into Southeast Asia. In Thailand, following a few hours of
resistance and subsequent rebirth as a Japanese ally, over thirty
thousand regular Thai soldiers advanced into the Shan states of Burma in
May, 1942 and established a military occupation there, though they soon
lost enthusiasm for the venture and secured local ceasefires with the
mostly Chinese forces that opposed them. On Java, in the occupied Dutch
East Indies, a volunteer force was announced by the Japanese military
administration in October, 1943 with a similar plan announced in
occupied Malaya two months later in December.[^^[413]^^](#_ftn413) In
Indochina, where Japan maintained a strained relationship with local
Vichy French administrators until March 1945, serious efforts to create
a large scale volunteer army was not begun until a few weeks prior to
surrender.[^^[414]^^](#_ftn414) In China, Japanese commanders pursued a
twofold strategy, dating back to the warlord politics of the late 1920s.
Where it established or sponsored its own client administrations, such
as Manchuria, “autonomous” governments in northern China and the new
Nationalist regime under Wang Jingwei, the Japanese military provided
direct but very limited military support and training to “national”
armies. As elsewhere, officers supplemented this strategy with tactical
flexibility in the field; its units often cooperating with existing
small, independent and armed groups, whether they were bandits, rural
militias, or armed elements of religious organizations.

In the Philippines the two best known sources of armed support for the
occupation were the Bureau of Constabulary, which operated from around
mid-1942 to its collapse as an (in)effective fighting force in the fall
of 1944, and the League of Patriotic Filipinos, known by its abbreviated
Tagalog name Makapili (Tagalog: Kalipunang Makabayan ngmga Pilipino
Japanese: *firipin aikoku dōshi kai*), which was founded in November
1944 and lasted until the collapse of the Japanese occupation in the
summer of 1945. There were also a number of other organizations, often
with overlapping memberships. The *Yōin* (要員) is occasionally
mentioned, although its members were most often engaged as laborers
along the lines of the various auxiliaries that Japan employed all over
occupied territories, often termed *heiho* (兵補).[[415]](#_ftn415) The
leading historian on military collaboration in the Philippines, Motoe
Terami-Wada, has also identified a number of other independent
auxiliaries which were recruited locally and attached to Japanese units
either for labor purposes but which sometimes participated in military
action. Around the same time as the founding of the Makapili, a “New
Leaders Association” was formed which had an armed division headed by
Aurelio Alvero. Alvero’s treason trial was one of the few cases of a
higher level figure receiving a conviction, which the Supreme Court
affirmed in 1950. Artemio Ricarte, a leading nationalist veteran of the
Philippine-American war, organized his own “Volunteer Army of Peace and
Order of the Philippines.”[^^[416]^^](#_ftn416) The two armies were
merged in January of 1945 and, with the exception of a brief mention of
the "Peace Army" of Ricarte, neither left much of a trace in the
historical records. As Terami-Wada points out, this flurry of
mobilization activity in late 1944 was as confusing to the average
Filipino as it is to historians now, and many came to see all of them,
including the Makapili, as constituting a single overtly pro-Japanese
army.[^^[417]^^](#_ftn417)

The largest number and best, if still poorly equipped force under arms
in the occupied Philippines was the Bureau of Constabulary (BoC). The
BoC, or just the Constabulary as it was more frequently called, was in
many ways the successor to the Philippine Constabulary it was modeled
upon, which had a long prewar history dating back to
1901.[^^[418]^^](#_ftn418) Indeed, two prewar heads of the Constabulary,
Jose de los Reyes and Guillermo B. Francisco, were each made director,
in turn, of its Japanese sponsored equivalent. The BoC was, however,
structurally somewhat differently from its predecessor in that it
included all local police and its military aspects were deliberately
toned down by the Japanese military administration until the founding of
the Republic in 1943.[^^[419]^^](#_ftn419) The organization was
established in early 1942, but it did not truly get off the ground until
after the surrender of Bataan in April when a large number of Philippine
prisoners of war, many of them with prewar Constabulary experience, fell
into Japanese hands.[^^[420]^^](#_ftn420)

The BoC was never designed to fight alongside Japanese soldiers across
its far-flung battlefronts. It was exclusively used for domestic
policing and counterinsurgency purposes. As in the case of Indian
National Army recruits, it was created in large part by recruiting
directly from POW camps. Neither Indians nor Filipinos escaped the
hardships of Japanese prisoner of war camps, despite occasional better
treatment than white prisoners, but many Filipino prisoners entered the
camps directly from a harrowing death march that followed a long and
hard-fought defense on the Bataan peninsula in the first months of 1942.
In the Philippines, the prospects for continued survival in a diseased
and starving prisoner of war camp were particularly slim, especially in
Camp O’Donnell in Capas, where daily prisoner deaths reached 500 in May
and were still 100 by July.[^^[421]^^](#_ftn421) While Mohan Singh’s
volunteers in Singapore were promised glory at the liberation of a
distant India still under British rule, Filipinos recruited into the BoC
were offered only the opportunity to preserve a brutal Japanese military
occupation over their home country that already had its own functioning
domestic government and Constitution before the conquest.

 The diary of a captured torpedo boat captain Ramon A. Alcaraz offers us
a look at the recruitment into and “double game” of an officer in the
BoC. Together with 1,400 other POWs, Alcaraz was enrolled in a
“Rejuvenation Training” program led by Hamamoto Masakatsu, who impressed
the prisoners with his, “Harvard English and American
knowledge.”[^^[422]^^](#_ftn422) A variety of Japanese and Filipino
guest speakers were brought in to offer seminars to the prisoners on the
future of the newly liberated archipelago, including Claro Recto and
Jose P. Laurel.[^^[423]^^](#_ftn423) The POWs who “graduated” from the
program with Alcaraz on August 10, 1942 were told by former Defense
Secretary Teofilo Sison, the only leading political collaborator to be
convicted of treason after the war, that all of them were expected to
dedicate themselves to the new Philippine
government.[^^[424]^^](#_ftn424) Receiving his conditional release
papers, Alcaraz was ordered to report for training at a police academy
in Manila in 20 days.[^^[425]^^](#_ftn425) Within three months of his
transition from POW to a BoC officer, however, Alcaraz had attained a
parallel guerrilla rank of Major in control of elements of the 14^th^
infantry resistance forces in the province of Nueva
Vizcaya.[^^[426]^^](#_ftn426) This guerrilla organization had just
suffered a severe setback after the Japanese capture of its leader
Colonel Guillermo Nakar in November.[^^[427]^^](#_ftn427) The example of
the execution of this same Nakar, after refusing to collaborate with the
Japanese, would find mention in postwar amnesty debates in the
legislature. Only a few days after his appointment in the resistance,
Alcaraz records a meeting with his provincial counterpart, the head of
Japanese military police, at which he promised to do his part in the
work of crushing the local remnants of the very guerrilla organization
he had just assumed control over.[^^[428]^^](#_ftn428)

 In early 1943, we find Alcaraz claiming that he distracted the local
pro-Japanese Governor of the province, the chief of the local Japanese
military police and the head of the Japanese Army Garrison by pouring
his efforts into developing new neighborhood associations, which were
designed to promote security through mutual responsibility. Instead,
Alcaraz focused on such tasks as securing more Japanese instructors to
teach its members morning radio calisthenics.[^^[429]^^](#_ftn429)
Although the participation of Filipinos in neighborhood radio
calisthenics or in various parades and performances helped contribute to
an image of tranquil cooperation with the occupier, according to another
wartime diary, at least one local Japanese official was not fooled into
thinking this implied any enthusiasm for the Japanese cause. Watching
one such parade, on the anniversary of the fall of Bataan, his Filipino
companion told him ninety per cent of the Filipinos now understood
Japan's objective to unify Greater East Asia. The Japanese official
allegedly responded,

You are mistaken,–I am afraid that forty-five per cent of the population
continues to be pro-American, five per cent are pro-Japanese, while the
remaining fifty per cent are comedians.[^^[430]^^](#_ftn430)\
 \

Later the same year in November 1943, the same diarist, Marcial Lichauco
records a conversation between his wife Jessie and a BoC officer on
patrol. She asked the Constabulary officer what they would do when the
American troops returned and the Japanese called on them to fight. The
officer reported that several of his fellow BoC companions had asked
their commanding officer that very question and were told that, “When
that happy day comes it would be a case of every man for himself and
good luck to all of us.”[^^[431]^^](#_ftn431) This was also the
expectation of U.S. G-2 military intelligence which, in a report
compiled in June, 1943, recorded guerrilla reports claiming that any
attack on the occupied Philippines that “looks as if it might be
successful” would result in most of the Constabulary turning against the
Japanese.[^^[432]^^](#_ftn432)

It is not terribly surprising, then, to find that all sources agree that
the wartime BoC was an ineffectual, disloyal and corrupt organization.
The Japanese military placed little or no confidence in its new
Constabulary, and the widespread disloyalty of its officers did not go
unnoticed. The life of its director Guillermo Francisco, who was
suspected by the Japanese of working with the guerrillas, was only saved
with the help of President Laurel, and his troops were poorly equipped
and frequently subject to humiliation and
mistreatment.[^^[433]^^](#_ftn433) As we have already mentioned, the
replacement for Francisco, General Paulino Santos, was also reported to
have played a part in the organization of guerrillas but he also wrote
eloquent letters to a friend in the guerrilla movement, trying to
persuade him to surrender and collaborate.[^^[434]^^](#_ftn434) He was
eventually arrested by the Japanese and died in their custody.

Most soldiers of the BoC did refuse to fight the returning Americans in
the fall of 1944 and deserted in large numbers; its total strength
dropping from 18,000 in August to 7,500 in December before the
Constabulary was completely disarmed in the spring of
1945.[^^[435]^^](#_ftn435) The fact that many BoC officers were widely
engaged in the “double game” before their mass desertion is difficult to
contest. At the very least they were hedging their bets. Not only BoC
officers themselves or others who serve the occupation government but
also many guerrilla leaders confirmed that a cooperative or at least a
non-hostile relationship existed between some units of the resistance
and elements in the Constabulary.[^^[436]^^](#_ftn436) The ineffectual
patrols of the BoC were usually preferred by the resistance to the more
attentive ones by the Japanese. At the same time it was equally clear
that, prior to the fall of 1944, the BoC was increasingly active in
Japanese-led mopping up operations and general “pacification” campaigns
carried out at the behest of the Japanese military or by order of other
Filipino government officials.[^^[437]^^](#_ftn437) The same U.S. G-2
military intelligence report which recorded the high potential of the
BoC to turn on the Japanese also noted their responsibility for the
deaths of USAFFE guerrillas and that “to a limited extent” they had been
employed as “undercover agents and spies” by the
Japanese.[^^[438]^^](#_ftn438) Japanese activity reports on mopping-up
work collected by the American forces, while slim on details, are full
of references to punitive raids being carried out, “in cooperation with
the police,” “aided by the police,” and “working [in] conjunction with
the police unit.”[^^[439]^^](#_ftn439)

The many Japanese soldiers who came to the Philippines with years of
counterinsurgency experience in China would not have been particularly
surprised at the duplicity of the armed Filipinos who joined them in
suppressing the resistance.[^^[440]^^](#_ftn440) Though generally
employed under less coercive conditions, Japanese allied “puppet armies”
of the new Nationalist regime and earlier autonomous governments in
China were no more dependable and equally liable to switch sides when an
appropriate opportunity presented itself. However, accounts of
individual acts of defiance, cases of BoC informing guerrillas of
upcoming attacks, the ignoring of orders, or any number of interventions
by BoC officers to save suspected guerrillas from execution at the hands
of the Japanese military police can easily distract us from the fact
that almost every “double game” had two sides. There were strong
incentives to preserve anecdotes from one game and not of the brutality
required to sustain the other. It is easy to get mired in the task of
sorting patriots from opportunists or the vengeful from the true
believers in a Greater East Asia. At the very least, however, the role
played by the BoC in wartime atrocities and evidence of postwar
continuities, as we shall see, offer plenty of reasons for the historian
to question the remarkable imbalance in the postwar allotment of
retribution against military collaborators.

 If the BoC is portrayed as the reluctant ally biding its time or
actively subverting the Japanese occupation, the Makapili invokes,
however inaccurately, the image of the devoted turncoat, or as the
leading historian of Philippine-Japanese relations Grant Goodman once
described them, a “fanatical, self immolating Filipino
militia.”[^^[441]^^](#_ftn441) However, much like the reviled Milice of
Vichy France, the image of the passionately committed collaborationist
is found side-by-side with that of the opportunism of a ruffian or the
ignorance of a teenager such as the embittered peasant Milice recruit of
the 1974 French film “Lucien Lacombe.” In the 1968 film, “Manila, Open
City,” about the 1945 battle of Manila, which came complete with a
narrator supplying historical commentary for each section, a Filipino
guerrilla tells his American companion that the Makapili were, “a few
local punks and ex-cons…” However, the roots of this organization
reaches much farther back than its founding in November 1944. Many of
its members were part of the Ganap political party or movement, and its
older members were associated with the Ganap’s predecessor, the Sakdal
rural reform and nationalist movement which was active from 1930 up
until the movement's failed uprising in 1935. The names Sakdal and Ganap
are almost synonyms, the former meaning “the most” or “extremely”, and
the latter meaning “entirely” or “completely,” but Sakdal also has the
meaning of “to accuse.”[^^[442]^^](#_ftn442) The Sakdal movement was
founded in June 1930 following two racially charged incidents between
Filipinos and embraced the goal of attaining immediate independence from
the United States.[^^[443]^^](#_ftn443) The movement's charismatic
leader was the poet and civil servant Benigno Ramos, who initially
directed the energies of the movement towards “accusing” the United
States of enslaving the Filipino people and its Filipino collaborator
regime of starving the poor through the movement’s key publication
*Sakdal.*Spreading rapidly through Luzon, in the years that followed the
movement organized a boycott of foreign goods, raised money for the
independence revolutionary in Japanese exile, Artemio Ricarte, supported
a Gandhi-inspired civil disobedience movement toward the goal of
independence, and in October, 1933 founded a political party which
further promised radical economic reforms and the complete
transformation of society.[^^[444]^^](#_ftn444) In the 1934 elections it
sent all three of its congressional candidates to the House and won
numerous other positions at the provincial and municipal levels. After
failing to prevent the transition of the Phillippines to Commonwealth
status, it organized a dramatic and violent uprising that took place
over a single night in May, 1935 and collapsed immediately
after.[^^[445]^^](#_ftn445) Ramos was already in Japan at the time of
the uprising but returned briefly to the Philippines in 1938. Despite a
cordial meeting with Commonwealth president Quezon in Japan after which
he reversed his longstanding opposition and pledged support for Quezon's
Nacionalista party, Ramos was arrested immediately upon his return.
While on bail and awaiting trial he founded a new political party,
Ganap, composed of those remaining followers who could stomach his new
alliance with the elites, but he was again arrested for fraud and
illegal solicitation of funds in 1939.[^^[446]^^](#_ftn446) Ramos was
finally released from prison by the Japanese occupation forces in April
1942, only after the military administration had established a new
occupation regime composed of prewar elites.

 Why did Japan not immediately take advantage of this figure with a long
history of opposing American imperialism? The answer is found in a
unique characteristic of Japan’s Philippine experience. If there was one
thing that the best known wartime collaborators with Japan had in
common, it was that they were on the down and out. Benigno Ramos and
Artemio Ricarte in the Philippines, Subhas Chandra Bose and Rash Behari
Bose from India, Ba Maw and Aung San in Burma, Sukarno and Mohammad
Hatta in the Dutch East Indies, Ibrahim Yaacob in British Malaya, former
emperor Puyi and Wang Jingwei in China had failed to achieve their
goals, whether in the political arena or through revolution. Whatever
their optimism, they faced the possibility of a future on the margins.
Ricarte, Aung San, and Rash Behari Bose fled or were sent into exile,
ending up in Japan where they found support from radical pan-Asianist
organizations. Before Japan restored his empire in Manchurian miniature
in 1932, Pu Yi spent more than half a decade under its protection in the
Tianjin Japanese concession. Ba Maw and Ramos were languishing in prison
until they were released by the Japanese and both Sukarno and Hatta were
freed from their remote domestic exile following the conquest of the
Dutch colony. After being expelled from his position as editor of the
Malay nationalist newspaper *Majlis*,**Yaacob sought out support and
funding from both British and Japanese sources in exchange for becoming
an espionage agent, and was arrested by the British at the outbreak of
war. Subhas Chandra Bose and Wang Jingwei were both charismatic, widely
respected, and powerful contenders to become the leading political
figure in their respective nations, but the rise of each was eventually
thwarted by his political nemesis.[^^[447]^^](#_ftn447) For Bose it was
Gandhi's opposition to his election as Congress President in 1939; for
Wang it was Chiang Kai-shek's purge of Wang followers at the Third
National Congress of the Nationalist party in 1929. Nowhere in the
territories it occupied did Japan so successfully forge an alliance with
almost all of the ruling political elites as it did in the
Philippines.[^^[448]^^](#_ftn448)

 Recognizing the advantages of working, for once, with the mainstream of
political power, the Japanese military administration in the Philippines
was reluctant to permit unpredictable and radical revolutionaries to
become its primary connection to the people and more importantly, the
leaders of armed military organizations. Thus, while it released Ramos
and permitted Ricarte to return from exile, and Japanese troops did arm
some of the generally pro-Japanese Ganap members in the early period of
the occupation, both remained relatively marginalized
figures.[^^[449]^^](#_ftn449) In fact, the creation of a single
political party, called the Kalibapi, in December 1942, far from being a
vehicle to organize collaborating elites into a single political
machine, was, some argued, primarily a means to keep Ramos and his
followers in line under the guidance of its director-general Benigno S.
Aquino, an establishment figure with decades of legislative experience.
From early on in the occupation, the head of the pre-Republic Philippine
Executive Commission, Jorge Vargas, had urged the Japanese to outlaw the
Sakdal-Ganap movement.[^^[450]^^](#_ftn450) Occupation officials were
also concerned. In his 1943 notes from a research trip to Manila
together with leading intellectual voices of the Greater East Asia
Co-prosperity Sphere, Rōyama Masamichi (蝋山政道) and Miki Kiyoshi
(三木清), Professor Takeuchi Tatsuji (武内辰治) quotes Shiohara Tamotsu,
the executive director of the Philippine Society of Japan on the issue,

Many Sakdalistas were utilized in the Manila area by the Japanese army.
The army people, however, did not know the real nature of the
Sakdalistas. We have reason to be cautious in dealing with them,
particularly in the Laguna area. Provided with arms, the Sakdalistas,
instead of combating banditry, did not hesitate to resort to extortion
against good citizens in the region. They even levied private taxes on
the inhabitants...The founding of the Kalibapi organizations was
primarily aimed at the liquidation of the Sakdal
party.[^^[451]^^](#_ftn451)

During a meeting with the wartime education minister Camilo Osias, the
wartime education minister, Takeuchi found him offering a similar
explanation, “[The Kalibapi] was conceived as a formula to incorporate
the Sakdalistas. It lacked unity at its inception; it included many
factions. Ramos is a good orator, but he has no brains. His subordinates
have less.”[^^[452]^^](#_ftn452) In their study on the Philippine polity
that resulted from their research trip, Takeuchi and Rōyama concluded
that while the radical peasants who made up the Sakdal movement were not
communists, their approach was an example of a “deformed politicization
of the land question” and were a mass movement “propelled by a series of
farm riots and agitations” which stood no chance at developing into a
national political party, and thus “superior talents were not attracted
to this organization.”[^^[453]^^](#_ftn453) While the Bureau of
Constabulary was far from reliable, Ramos and the radical reform
movement he led were not seen as a viable alternative until the
desperate days following the American landings of late 1944. It was in
this new environment of urgency that the Makapili was born with Ramos as
its executive general, Ricarte as an advisor, the openly pro-Japanese
Pio Duran as its vice-supremo and President Laurel, who only reluctantly
agreed to recognize the organization in the face of Japanese threats,
occupying a token position as honorary supreme
advisor.[^^[454]^^](#_ftn454)

In her diary entry noting the formation of the Makapili Pacita Pestaño
Jacinto summarized the leadership of the new organization:

Ricarte, the returned exile, is in his rightful element. He represents
the man who was born a rebel, who will tug at a leash no matter how
gentle, no matter how long. Pio Duran should have been born a Japanese,
not a Filipino. The greatest danger lies in Ramos, the communist. The
agrarian question has always been an issue. It is the quickest, most
effective weapon for the breeding of discontent. A glib speaker needs
nothing concrete. He has only to paint word pictures of a Utopia and the
deed is done. Ramos is a man of the masses. He speaks their language, he
knows which are the chords that, when plucked, will ring
true.[^^[455]^^](#_ftn455)

The day after its official inauguration on December 8, 1944,
the*Tribune* announced that, although the Japanese could fend off the
American invaders by themselves, “the national self-respect and the
ardor of our traditional patriotism do not allow the Filipinos…to just
sit by while our cities and civilian centers are being bombed and burned
and our helpless fellow countrymen driven to untold economic misery or
otherwise mercifully saved by shrapnel and machine guns strafing from
further torture. Hence, the Makapili.”[^^[456]^^](#_ftn456) Instead of
building a full army, however, the Makapili was to focus on the tasks of
preserving peace and order against the “enemy from within” and securing
food supplies. Their anthem declared that, “we are soldiers, you and I
are soldiers / [We are of] the Asian race … the Makapilis are the
protectors of the nation's children…”[^^[457]^^](#_ftn457)

 The new Makapili were heavily concentrated in Manila, and the nearby
Laguna and Rizal provinces, a fact confirmed by treason cases which
mention the Makapili, the majority of which come from Laguna province
(See Map 1) and especially the city of Santa Rosa. According to
Terami-Wada, some ninety per cent of the founding members of the
Makapili were formerly Yōin who in turn had many Ganap
members.[^^[458]^^](#_ftn458) This is again consistent with the areas of
Luzon where the Sakdal-Ganap movements were most concentrated in the
1930s. The total number recruited into the organization does not seem to
have exceeded about 5,000.[^^[459]^^](#_ftn459) In interviews with
former Makapili, some insisted that they were not volunteers but were
selected or conscripted into the organization. Others claimed they were
Ganap members who, despite having no desire to continue to support the
Japanese, found themselves associated with the Makapili and were forced
to flee with the Japanese to escape capture and
liquidation.[^^[460]^^](#_ftn460)

It is difficult to establish what, in fact, the Makapili did and did not
do since they were only active in the confused last months of the
Japanese occupation when its forces were already in retreat and rarely
stayed in one place for very long. One report finds them engaged in a
suicide attack with bayonets on Americans who had just landed in
Lingayan, while in a 1973 interview, Japanese Major General Utsunomiya
Naokata (宇都宮直賢) insisted that, although they engaged in some combat
east of Manila, the Makapili mostly dug trenches, served as guides, and
collected intelligence similar to other *heiho*
auxiliaries.[^^[461]^^](#_ftn461) Despite the relative scarcity of
information about their activity as an organization, their imprint on
historical memory and in the testimony of treason trials after the war
is considerable. The sign that is Makapili is “sticky,” in that a range
of dark memories about the occupation have become attached to it: most
of all in a role as particular kind of dreaded informer known as the
“magic eye.”

*Zona and Magic Eyes*

The most frightening thing I remember was the sight of the Makapilis
with bayong (native bags weaved from the fronds of a native palm tree
called buri) over their head, with two holes for their eyes. I didn't
see them very often, but whenever I saw them, there were always were
many men strung together with some guarded by Japanese. They betrayed
their town mates by pointing them out to the
Japanese.[^^[462]^^](#_ftn462)

I watched a spy with a bayon over his head so that he would not be
recognized, point to a guerillero, Gonzalo Navarro…Spies with bayons
over their heads, which the Tagalogs called Makapilis, we called the
Quinta Columna, the fifth column of the Japanese—traitors,
spies.[^^[463]^^](#_ftn463)

Sometimes the Japanese had Filipinos with hoods over their heads come
into a room of people who had been rounded up during a zona and simply
point at those who were “guilty.” “These [hooded] people,” explained a
man in San Ricardo, "were what we called makapili.”[^^[464]^^](#_ftn464)

I also discovered the identities of the Makapilis who hid their faces
with bayong (bags). After the enemy conducted raids, I tailed these
‘stool pigeons’ when they returned to their bivouac with their
‘masters.’ The moment these bastards left their encampment, we, the
Trigger Squad, killed them.[^^[465]^^](#_ftn465)

Though it was a short-lived organization with few members only active in
a small geographical range, the historical memories of the Makapili has
become inextricably tied to the image of the treasonous informants who
accompanied the Japanese on their counterinsurgency raids throughout the
occupation period. Both in oral histories collected long after the war,
in the testimonies of victims and witnesses in the early postwar trials,
and in films and other postwar media, the term Makapili has broadened to
be used interchangeably with traitor, spy, and informant. It is referred
to in places where the Makapili was never active, and in periods of the
occupation long before the organization was founded. The evil which the
name invokes, however, cannot be fully appreciated without considering
the association of the Makapili with one particular kind of hooded
informant known as the “Magic Eye.” In the Philippines, the Magic Eye
technique was sometimes employed when assembling the entire population
of a village or an urban district in a practice the Filipinos referred
to as “zoning” (*zona* or *sona*) during which each man and, in some
accounts, woman was lined up in front of, or had to file past an “Eye”
who nodded or pointed fingers at guerrilla suspects, thereby condemning
them to a death at the hands of a Japanese sword or bayonet or at least
arrest, interrogation and torture.

The Magic Eyes were the darkest shadow of collaboration in the
Philippines. In the municipal and national offices reluctant
bureaucrats, politicians and elites are mostly described as busily
ignoring or diluting Japanese directives that came their way, all the
while sending intelligence to the guerrilla groups in their area.
Meanwhile, in the villages and rural areas, where immediate proximity to
violence was unavoidable, the consequences of collaboration were most
apparent in the example of these anonymous characters. In film, these
frightful figures can be found in the early postwar Hollywood film shot
in the archipelago “An American Guerrilla in the Philippines” (1950) and
more recently in the 2001 Philippine submission for Best Foreign
Language Film at the Academy Awards, “In the Bosom of the Enemy”
(“Gatas… Sa dibdib ng kaaway”), the 2004 film “Aishite Imasu Mahal Kita”
(I love you), and, though replacing the *bayong*****bag with a white
mask, in the 2005 U.S. film, “The Great Raid.”

The Japanese use of hooded informants was not limited to the
archipelago. It is also frequently mentioned in accounts of *sook-ching*
(*shukusei,* *suqing*) “mopping-up” campaigns, often directed against
ethnic Chinese populations in occupied Malaya and in Singapore, where
the Magic Eyes were known as the “hooded terrors.”[^^[466]^^](#_ftn466)
Nor was their employment a Japanese innovation. The use of hooded
informants in identification parades, and the hatred their use
engendered is found in countless other historical cases and tied
directly to the history of witness identification. In German occupied
Greece, the occupiers assembled the population in a practice known as
*bloccos* and had hooded informants point out EAS/ELAS guerrilla
suspects.[^^[467]^^](#_ftn467) During the Mau Mau Rebellion in Kenya,
the British employed Kikuyu loyalist informers called *gikunia,*named
for the sack which covered their entire bodies, to point out suspected
Mau Mau rebels.[^^[468]^^](#_ftn468) In Chile, in Guatemala, and
elsewhere in Latin America the hooded *encapuchados*, often guerrillas
who had succumbed under torture, pointed out their
fellows.[^^[469]^^](#_ftn469) In Punjab and in Kashmir, the Magic Eyes
were called “cats” (from “concealed apprehension technique”) and were
used by the Indian police and military.[^^[470]^^](#_ftn470) In the
Philippines, however, the eyes hidden behind the *bayong* bag have
reached a particularly powerful status as a historical symbol, and as
the imagined uniform of the Makapili. The practice of “zoning” that in
some cases employed hooded informants was used by Japanese forces
throughout the occupation of the Philippines, long before the founding
of the Makapili in December, 1944, and well beyond the central Luzon
plains where they were most active. One memoir by a lawyer and later
historian makes its first reference to *zona*, though no informer
appears, in an anecdote from the very first month of the Japanese
occupation: January, 1942.[^^[471]^^](#_ftn471) Despite the fact the
connection between the Makapili and the “magic eye” was widespread, it
was rarely made in the court. Though there are many references to
pointing informers and even the Magic Eye, the *bayong* masked terrors
are less frequently mentioned in the case summaries for trials of
Makapili. Instead, the tell-tale signs of a Makapili, from the
perspective of testifying witnesses, were the wearing of a Japanese
military cap, a uniform, or merely an armband with Japanese writing upon
it.

As the opening quotes of this section suggest, the Magic Eye ‘Makapili’
are often depicted without any thought given to the coercion that may
have been brought to bear upon them. By contrast, in her diary of the
occupation, Pacita Pestaño Jacinto offers a description of zoning in
late 1944 Manila that imagines the perspective of the Magic Eye in a way
that is more consistent with the similar use of hooded informants around
the world:

Without warning, without explanation, on the strength of mere suspicion,
one or more street is cordoned, bayonets flash, soldiers break into
houses and all males regardless of age or profession are caught and
taken away in trucks. Assembled in the public square they are forced to
stand under the sun. Then a man hooded in black is brought out. Through
small slits in the hood, he is forced to watch while each man parades
slowly in front of him. This man is usually a guerrilla who has been
caught and tortured and beaten and as a last punishment is designated to
act as the magic eye. As the magic eye, he is forced to point out from
among those who have been “zoned” the ones he suspects of being members
of guerrilla bands. He himself does not know, but he is forced to point
out someone, anyone. The threat of a second torture proves too much. He
closes his eyes and his wavering finger points once, twice, thrice. It
depends on how thirsty for blood the Japanese officer happens to
be.[^^[472]^^](#_ftn472)

*Toward a Limited Amnesty*

The Bureau of Constabulary, the Makapili, and the unforgettable image of
the Magic Eye represented the reality of the Japanese occupation and
military occupation on the ground. These working relationships between
Japanese and Filipinos, sometimes marred by coercion and a complex
political background cannot be completely separated from the elite
levels of collaboration because it was the occupation government’s
leading officials in the field of security and within the Constabulary
who helped organize and manage the cooperation taken place at the lower
levels. However, almost none of these figures would face trials for the
“command responsibility” they bore in the postwar, or face final
conviction in treason trials.

One of the most basic reasons why all the leading political
collaborators were so quickly rehabilitated both politically and in
memory is that none, save the very first to come to trial, were
convicted of treason.[^^[473]^^](#_ftn473) Ricarte and Ramos, did not
survive into the postwar. Others, such as Aquino, did not live to see
the conclusion of their trial. The trials of some, including Laurel,
were delayed until the amnesty was passed. Many others were saved by the
strict two witness rule inherited from American treason law. As
clarified in a key 1944 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, “every act, movement,
deed and word of the defendant charged to constitute treason must be
supported by the testimony of two witnesses.”[^^[474]^^](#_ftn474) It
was understandably difficult for Solicitor General Lorenzo M. Tañada to
find the testimony of two witnesses to the signing of a treasonous
document, or the issuing of a treasonous order when such acts were often
carried out in the relative privacy of an office. The overwhelming case
load did not help move the process along, either. The special People's
Courts established by Commonwealth Act No. 682 in September, 1945 to
handle all occupation period violations of Article 114 of the Revised
Penal Code, that is, the crime of treason, consisted of a mere five
courts with three judges each.

Finally, even without the amnesty to come many collaborators had little
to fear from the People's Court after it ruled that the holding of
government offices during the Japanese occupation neither constituted an
overt act rendering “aid and comfort” to the enemy nor provided
sufficient evidence of adherence to the enemy—the two required
components of any treason conviction in the Philippines as it is in the
United States. This was a marked contrast with laws for the punishment
of collaboration with Japan in, for example, Nationalist or Communist
controlled territories of China or in South Korea, for example, where
high office holders were explicitly targeted, even if mitigating clauses
offered judges great flexibility.[^^[475]^^](#_ftn475) In the
Philippines, the bar for adherence to the enemy was set so high that it
required the prosecution to virtually step into the hearts of the
accused and prove they were completely empty of patriotic feeling. Words
spoken in praise of the Japanese Empire or calling for guerrillas to lay
down their arms were but the moving of a helpless puppet's lips; war
materials sold to the enemy were just the everyday business of an honest
merchant. As long as a collaborator spoke other words in private against
the occupier or contributed some percentage of their profits to the
resistance, the possibility of “feigned cooperation”—the favorite term
of the accused and judges alike, could not be ruled out. In his account
of the progress of the People's Court up to the amnesty, David Joel
Steinberg traces the “growing sympathy” of the courts for claims of
“justifying circumstances,” until finally procedural issues came to
dominate each case in the final lead-up to the 1948 Proclamation Number
51 and the dismantlement of the People’s Court a few months
later.[^^[476]^^](#_ftn476) Steinberg and a more recent historian of the
treason trials, Augusto V. De Viana count 156 convictions, out of either
5,603 or 5,556 People’s Court cases.[^^[477]^^](#_ftn477) Steinberg ends
his history of collaboration in the Philippines with the amnesty, and
understandably so, given that he, like many historians of the occupation
and aftermath have been interested in explaining the almost complete
co-optation of Filipino elites into the wartime administration by the
Japanese military. From the perspective of understanding the
relationship between treason and atrocities, however, the amnesty finds
us closer to the beginning of the story than its end.

The 1948 amnesty did not eliminate the issue of collaboration, it
transformed and contained it. To understand this transformation we must
look closer at Proclamation Number 51 itself (See Appendix A) and the
debate that surrounded it. The proclamation states that while the
People's Court had been trying cases for more than two years it had not
reached a final judgment on any “treasonable collaboration with the
enemy.” Assuming that final judgment was taken to mean that the appeal
of convictions had been ruled upon by the Supreme Court, this was simply
untrue. Over two dozen treason convictions by the People's Court had
received final rulings from the Supreme Court *before* the amnesty, and
the original conviction was upheld in the majority of these
cases.[^^[478]^^](#_ftn478) The claim only makes sense if, instead of
all People's Court cases, it was limited to treason charges against
those emphasized in the opening clause who, “occupied positions in [the
occupation] government, as well as against those who traded with the
enemy.”

 The amnesty for those accused of treason arising from “the last war”
justified itself on three basic grounds:

​1) The two witness rule and other restrictions made the prosecution of
economic as well as political collaboration almost impossible

​2) The “majority of the Filipino people now realize” that political
collaborators acted under duress and as a shield against Japanese
brutality

​3) The collaboration issue divided the Filipino people at a time when
unity was essential.

 However, “public sentiment [did] not extend” to military collaborators
and those guilty of atrocities in the service of the enemy. It thus made
a clear exception:

That this amnesty shall not extend to persons who are now or may
hereafter be accused of treason for having taken up arms against the
allied nations or the members of the resistance forces, for having
voluntarily acted as spies or informers of the enemy, or for having
committed murder, arson, coercion, robbery, physical injuries, or any
other crime against person or property, for the purpose of aiding and
abetting the enemy in the war against the allied nations or in the
suppression of the resistance movement in the
Philippines.[^^[479]^^](#_ftn479)

 This amnesty was an exercise of executive power, rather than the
product of legislation. However, its proclamation would spark two weeks
of debate within the Senate and House of Representatives before each
passed the resolutions of concurrence constitutionally required for the
amnesty to take effect. These debates revealed significant disagreement
with the president not only over whether such an amnesty was
appropriate, but even more over its limited scope.[^^[480]^^](#_ftn480)
In the end, however, though many were absent for the vote, the
resolutions passed on the evening of February 13 with overwhelming
majorities of 50 to 8 in the House of Representatives and 14 to 2 in the
Senate. Those who voted against the amnesty in the House included
resistance veteran, future leader of the Huk suppression campaign, and
eventual President Ramon Magsaysay. In the Senate, opposition included
the same Lorenzo M. Tañada who had led the treason prosecution effort as
Solicitor General until he turned to a political career in the Senate.

The debates over the amnesty revealed a complex array of positions on
collaboration and the violence of military collaborators. Some opposed
the amnesty on principle. Hermenegildo Atienza, representing Manila, was
disgusted with the fact that collaborators were not only going free but
felt no shame at what they had done. “I cannot be merciful…I cannot vote
now for an amnesty under an atmosphere that glorifies collaboration,” he
declared.[^^[481]^^](#_ftn481) Jose Abad Santos was not the only wartime
hero who was killed after refusing to serve the Japanese. Atienza spoke
movingly of his time as a prisoner in Fort Santiago where his friend,
the guerrilla leader Guillermo Nakar, was offered an alternative to
execution: if he accepted a position as the governor of Isabela, the
Luzon province where his guerrillas were once active, his life would be
spared. He refused and was executed, and Atienza promised his friend
that his memory would not be forgotten. “If I vote for amnesty I would
have betrayed that trust: I would've been recreant to that word I
pledged before a dying man.”[^^[482]^^](#_ftn482) Future Philippine
President Ramon Magsaysay did not give his own lengthy speech on the
topic but he posed a long chain of questions to Manuel T. Cases,
representing La Union who, though he preferred a universal amnesty,
argued in favor of a partial one since, “Within a few days, or a few
weeks, there will be another proclamation of the president extending
amnesty to the smaller fries.”[^^[483]^^](#_ftn483) For Magsaysay, the
amnesty was a dangerous first step down a slippery slope that would
eventually extend to traitors who were guilty of murder and rape, who
should never be forgiven. “Fight amnesty, remember Basco,” he quoted
from a letter he received from the mayor of San
Antonio.[^^[484]^^](#_ftn484) Basco, he explained, was a spy that had
caused the death of thousands of people in the Luzon province of
Zambales.

Juan G. Rodriguez, representing Pangasinan, was opposed to any amnesty
not because it would free the guilty but because it denied political
collaborators accused of the crime the opportunity to expunge the shame
of the baseless accusation. “Why should I forgive these men who have not
committed any crime?”[^^[485]^^](#_ftn485) He voted no, because there
is, “nothing to forget or forgive, they were
innocent.”[^^[486]^^](#_ftn486) Timoteo P. Ricohermoso, representing
Marinduque, was against the amnesty for the same reason. The political
collaborators were “heroes of our cause” who deserved their day in court
to prove their patriotism.[^^[487]^^](#_ftn487) One of these “heroes,”
who had served in a number of positions during the war, including
Justice Minister and as one of the Peace and Order Committee members
that oversaw the pacification of guerrilla “bandits,” was among the
representatives who participated in the debates: Quintin Paredes. A
short U.S. collaborator profile compiled about Paredes during the war
added an unusually angry comment, “Utterly selfish and probably
cooperated with the Japanese because he believed they would win the
war.”[^^[488]^^](#_ftn488) In the final vote Paredes abstained because
he was himself involved in, “that drama which we might call a tragic
comedy of ‘collaboration’,” but his speech to the House offered an
eloquent defense of his wartime conduct.[^^[489]^^](#_ftn489) There was
nothing wrong with patriotic resistance leaders speaking up for him or
his continued service in government, he suggested. Paredes quoted de
Gaulle's justification for including Jules Jeanneney, who was
instrumental in the creation of the Vichy regime in 1940, in his 1944
cabinet, “I did not go to Vichy then but many who were there believed
they were serving their country in their own way.”[^^[490]^^](#_ftn490)
In the Senate debates going on at the same time it was Camilo Osias,
wartime education minister, who served as the voice for the political
collaborators. His reelection in 1947 was widely quoted as proof the
Philippine people knew he spoke the truth when he declared, “I yield to
no man in patriotism, and when I served under the Japs I did so because
I thought it was my duty to serve my people.”[^^[491]^^](#_ftn491) Of
course, Osias and Paredes avoided discussing whether those who hunted
down guerrillas or pointed out guerrilla suspects to the Japanese might
have shared the same desire to serve their country in their own way.
However, Paredes did not distinguish between himself and Ricarte and
Ramos, who were both, “really patriots.”

There were many more who spoke out in favor, not just of a partial
amnesty for economic and political collaborators, but a complete and
universal one for all crimes of treason during the war. Again their
arguments stemmed from different basic principles. Damaso T. Samonte,
representing Ilocos Norte, described the very idea of amnesty as,
“putting a bandage on a gangrenous wound,” which could not “cleanse the
nation's wounds of a highly potent and virulent
virus.”[^^[492]^^](#_ftn492) Did heroes such as the brave Jose Abad
Santos, he asked, die in vain? The Philippines was not alone in facing
this problem after the war but its other allies did not exhibit the,
“sickly sentimentality of Christian charity and a mistaken concept of
unity,” shown by President Roxas. He went on,

Where are the Quislings now? Laval of France had long been carted away
to the eternal sleep of infamy. Vidkun Quisling of Norway, Josef Tiso
and Karl Hermann Frank of Czechoslovakia, Anton Mussert, the Fuehrer of
the Netherlands, Leon Maria Joseph Ignace De Grelle of Belgium, and many
more others have long been liquidated without much of a ceremony except
that which is reasonably required by civilized
justice.[^^[493]^^](#_ftn493)\
 \

However, if amnesty was inevitable, Samonte argued, then it should be
for everyone. “I do not see any justice in exculpating the brain that
schemes and convicting the hand that executes. The finger man is just as
guilty as the trigger man.” On the contrary, if anything it was the
political collaborators who deserved more punishment. “His racket is
wholesale. He encompasses the entire mass of citizenry within the broad
sweep of his perfidy.”[^^[494]^^](#_ftn494)

Lorenzo Sumulong, a representative from Rizal who later became known
worldwide for sparking the Krushchev shoe-banging incident when he was
the Philippine representative at the United Nations in 1960, was also
disturbed to learn that, “the mercy to be extended will be given only to
the brains and buy and sell tycoons of the occupation” and not the,
“ignorant simpleminded credulous Filipino,” whose only crime was that he
was, “ready to believe the utterances of the prominent men of his
time.”[^^[495]^^](#_ftn495) As was repeatedly pointed out in the debate,
only a paltry 15% or so treason cases were covered by the amnesty.
According to a count by Representative Toribio Perez, there were some
472 cases involving political collaboration, 355 economic, and 100
related to cultural collaboration that were eligible for amnesty.
However, those ineligible were 2,677 cases involving espionage, enemy
agents, spies and informers and another 2,925 cases involving military
collaborators who were members of the Bureau of Constabulary, Makapili,
police and related organizations.[^^[496]^^](#_ftn496)

Sumulong was willing to accept the fact that the prominent men were
“unwilling instruments” but were they not, “bigger and deadlier enemies
than the ordinary soldier who takes up arms in the
fields?”[^^[497]^^](#_ftn497) When Mateo M. Nonato questioned how one
could call for a full amnesty for those, “bastards that ought to be
hanged” for serving as informers and spies who were directly responsible
for death of many Filipinos, Sumulong reminded the assembly that
Filipinos had killed each other and acted as informers during the
Philippine-American war but the United States had been willing to
forgive and forget in the aftermath. “Why should our government be more
strict or rigorous with these countryman of ours who are misled perhaps
during the occupation?”[^^[498]^^](#_ftn498)

For Sumulong and several other representatives such as Tapacio Nueno the
most troublesome aspect of the partial amnesty was that it was a clear
case of social injustice. Esmeraldo Eco, representing Camarines Norte,
was outraged for the same reason, “The most lamentable fact is that
those men who held important positions during the occupation, the
ranking officers of the Philippine Constabulary who issued orders to the
buck privates...who were responsible, perhaps, for all the miseries and
sufferings of our people are the only persons who will be benefited by
this grant of amnesty.” He was not against a general amnesty or even a
partial one but, “if amnesty is ever to be given, I repeat, it must
begin not from the very top, but from the rock
bottom.”[^^[499]^^](#_ftn499) Alejo S. Santos, representing Bulacan,
protested, how could Eco suggest that those with blood on their hands go
free first? It was, said Eco, a matter of command responsibility. Santos
disagreed, there could be no command responsibility for commanders who
were themselves not free to act.

In the Senate, Lorenzo M. Tañada, speaking from his experiences
prosecuting treason cases, also denounced the, “discriminatory, unjust
and vague” partial amnesty that left the “poor and ignorant” to languish
in prison. In addition, he already foresaw one of the weaknesses in the
exception provided by the amnesty that we shall have occasion to
consider below. Was it not strange, Tañada argued, that someone accused
of treason with rape would go free while someone accused of treason with
theft would not?[^^[500]^^](#_ftn500) Surely, responded Senator Carlos
S. Tan, common sense would prevail when faced with such circumstances.

 These opponents of partial amnesty concentrated on the objective fact
that it was overwhelmingly members of the lower classes who were accused
of the crimes of torture, murder, other acts of violence carried out on
behalf of the enemy, or of enabling such atrocities in their capacity as
informants. It was implied that it was only their poverty, their
ignorance, and their susceptibility to propaganda which led them to
commit such acts. Just as many of those who favored amnesty for
political collaborators took at face value their claims to have been
motivated only by patriotic sacrifice, most of those who argued for a
general amnesty studiously avoided confronting the possibility that the
common man might act out of personal revenge, greed, or a love of power.
If political collaborators were innocent because, it was suggested, they
could not prevent the brutality of the Japanese, the “smaller fries”
were innocent because, in their ignorance, they could not be expected to
refuse orders to carry it out.

Alejo S. Santos was not so sympathetic to military collaborators among
the lower classes and he was in a better position to speak against them.
Santos was a leading wartime guerrilla and formerly one of the few
delegates elected to the House of Representatives from the leftist
Democratic Alliance, which included the Communist Party and
representatives of the Hukbalahap guerrillas who would be formally
declared an illegal organization only two months
later.[^^[501]^^](#_ftn501) Santos argued that it might be true that a
partial amnesty would mostly favor the elites, but it was equally true
that the help of some of these collaborating elites was of great
assistance to the guerrillas. It was also undeniable which traitors were
hated the most by the wartime resistance,

The greatest fear…was not fear of the governors, nor the leaders, nor
Vargas, nor Laurel, nor the mayors of the different towns. If we ever
had fear in our hearts, it was because we fear that these Makapilis and
spies might spot us and betray us to the Japanese army…One thing is
sure, I want to make it of record here, that the president may issue to
a Makapili his freedom, but the minute the guerrilla learns that
Makapili has been set free, the guerrillas would get him and kill him.
That is the true spirit that is common among many guerrillas who really
share the feelings of the orphans and widows whose husbands and loved
ones were killed by Makapilis.[^^[502]^^](#_ftn502)

Santos did not buy the argument that the masses were docile creatures
merely following the orders of the leading puppets, “Makapilis could
never say that they became Makapilis in response to the speeches of Mr.
Vargas or Dr. Laurel or anybody else.”[^^[503]^^](#_ftn503) Yet even
Santos, perhaps because he knew a different kind of justice awaited the
military collaborators upon their release, preferred a general amnesty
to a partial one so that the country could finally, “give this
collaboration question to oblivion.”[^^[504]^^](#_ftn504) Felixberto M.
Serrano, representing Batangas, also avoided offering any explicit
defense of those guilty of atrocities when he argued that the country
should, “Put an end—the quicker and more general it is, the better—to
this collaboration question.”[^^[505]^^](#_ftn505) Though he would
reluctantly accept a partial amnesty, he argued that any debate about
the virtue of its passing should not concern its recipients. It was
simply not necessary to provide any excuse for collaborators or
determine their innocence or guilt. “The president and the people had
only in mind the country's welfare when this amnesty was issued.”

 Though many representatives made calls for a general amnesty instead of
a partial one they acknowledged that they stood on weak constitutional
grounds when they contemplated a refusal to concur with an executive
proclamation and demand its modification. Some representatives,
including Cosme P. Garcia, Marcial O. Rañola, and Simeon G. Toribio,
didn't think it was worth the effort to make a rousing speech in favor
of a more general amnesty and merely declared their preference for it
when announcing their vote.

The votes to concur with the amnesty did bring to a close political
debates on collaboration for half a decade, even though it affected a
small minority of cases.[^^[506]^^](#_ftn506) The People's Court itself
was, despite its modest scope, an expensive burden on the state treasury
and abolished by Republic Act 311. The 1946 budget set its cost at
P650,000, and during the 1948 debates its annual cost was quoted at
P1,126,570. Putting this into perspective, the operating budget for the
Department of Justice as a whole in 1947 was only P1,700,000 and the
entire estimated government revenues for the 1947-1948 fiscal year was
P130,000,000.[^^[507]^^](#_ftn507) Those costs did not entirely
disappear, however. The majority of treason cases were not covered by
the amnesty and were thereafter returned to regular criminal courts.
Though the budget provided was cut well out of proportion to the number
of cases eliminated by the amnesty, Act 311 still provided P375,000 to
pay the costs for remaining treason prosecutions and wages for fifteen
Special Attorneys dedicated to those cases.

With the disappearance of the People's Court, an institution which
represented the surgeon who operated upon the “gangrenous” wounds of the
nation, together with the amnesty proclamation and resolutions of
concurrence supported widely across party and factional lines, the
collaboration issue immediately became less visible and depoliticized.
Unlike Burma and India, in the Philippines, there was a two step
process. First treason cases involving atrocities and military
collaboration were segregated from prominent political cases. They were
then merged together with regular criminal cases in criminal courts not
designed to handle the complexities of a wartime occupation or the
special considerations of evidence and so on that helped justify special
treason tribunals. The crime itself remained treason. Inevitably, given
the large number of cases that remained, this prolonged the process
significantly even as it removed the issue from political consideration.
In the next chapter we will examine some of the many cases that remained
in the courts and how the laws of treason continued to serve as a poor
weapon against the crimes of war.

\

**Chapter 6: Trials and Aftermath, 1947-1953**

The amnesty of 1948 pulled the issue of retribution against wartime
collaborators out of the political arena, achieving something the
British had failed to accomplish in either India or Burma. In India
trials were attempted but at a huge cost, while in Burma, the process
was aborted. In the Philippines the trials continued outside of the
public eye in regular criminal courts but remained trials for treason.
Through a subset of these trials, this chapter will identify the ways in
which the crime of treason was a poor alternative for war crimes or even
more common criminal laws against murder and other violence.

Many of the remaining accused Filipino traitors would be dismissed for
lack of evidence, a lack of two witnesses for each act, and other
technicalities. Some cases of military collaboration and wartime
atrocities committed in the service of the enemy would remain in the
courts for years after the 1948 amnesty. The People's Court Papers,
which contain the case files from most of the treason trials after the
war, are today housed in the University of the Philippines Main Library
in Diliman and any close study of the People's Court from September,
1945 to June, 1948 will need to consult that collection. However, a
portion of these cases were appealed to the Philippine Supreme Court,
the rulings of which are readily accessible in numerous Supreme Court
digests and legal databases.[^^[508]^^](#_ftn508) Some 157 of these
Philippine Supreme Court rulings on occupation period treason cases from
1947 to 1959 listed in Appendix B usually summarized the main charges,
findings, and selections from the evidence.[^^[509]^^](#_ftn509) De
Viana and Steinberg emphasize that less than 1% of People’s Court cases
were tried and reached conviction during the time of its existence, but
it is not known how many of the remaining untried cases that were turned
over to courts of first instance resulted in conviction. The 156 cases
in their count up to 1948 is extremely close in number to the count of
157 Supreme Court rulings I have identified, but it is less than half of
the 323 wartime collaborators who received a pardon in 1953. A closer
examination of cases in the lower courts after 1948 would be necessary
to compare post-amnesty conviction rates with the People’s Courts. The
prediction, in the amnesty debate, by Manuel T. Cases that a second more
complete amnesty would follow the one in 1948 within a few weeks was not
completely incorrect, if very premature. As we shall see, almost all of
the treason convictions considered here were covered in a mass pardon
issued by President Quirino in 1953 and only four of the cases come from
the years following it took effect on July 4.

The majority of the post-amnesty treason cases in the Philippines worked
their way through the courts from 1948 to 1953, through the increasingly
violent Huk rebellion, through the corruption plagued elections and the
conclusion of the Philippine war crimes trials in 1949, the suspension
of *habeas corpus* under presidential emergency powers in 1950, through
the sudden execution of over half a dozen Japanese war criminals in
January 1951, the rural reconstruction movement of 1952, and the
dramatic suppression of the Huks under the then Secretary of National
Defense, Ramon Magsaysay. Well over half of treason cases ruled upon by
the Philippine Supreme Court, some 92 in total, involved an accused
member of the occupation period Bureau of Constabulary (BoC), an alleged
member of the organization known as the Makapili, employees of the
Japanese military police, a "United Nippon" member (*yōin*) , a member
of the Coastal Defense Corps (CDC, *kaigun jiyūtai*), or other
unidentified uniformed military collaborator.

Notes: For full case list, see Appendix B. Cases listed in the table are
those in which membership in relevant organizations was alleged, but not
necessarily conceded by the court. Most cases contained 4-20 counts of
treason, and unlike other organizations, membership in the Bureau of
Constabulary was ruled not treasonous by itself (see below). Affirmed
convictions means the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court conviction
as guilty on at least one count of treason. Most of the remaining 65
cases examined were of informers, spies, agents, and those who
participated in some capacity on Japanese military raids but in which
such participation was explicitly alleged to have been enlisted in a
military organization.

Almost a third of all of the Supreme Court rulings on treason under
consideration, involved persons accused of—though judges were rarely
satisfied with evidence of the charge—being members of the Makapili, an
organization of no more than a few thousand which was primarily active
in only one area of the Philippines, the main island of Luzon, and which
only existed from November, 1944 through to the end of effective
Japanese resistance in the summer of 1945. By contrast, there were only
13 cases of members of the Bureau of Constabulary, far less than half of
those involving accused members of the Makapili, despite the fact this
military and policing organization of national scope and a peak size of
about 18,000 men was engaged in “pacification” campaigns against
anti-Japanese guerrillas from around the middle of
1942.[^^[510]^^](#_ftn510)

 The trial records of the People's Court contain the most complete
record of the many different forms of collaboration during the Japanese
occupation, including information collected by the U.S. Counter
Intelligence Corps. However, the range of atrocities committed by
military collaborators and informers, as well as some of the defining
features and problems of the Philippine approach to their punishment can
be seen in the Supreme Court rulings on treason cases appealed from the
People's Court or from the courts of first instance the cases were
transferred to after 1948 (See Appendix B for a list of rulings
considered). Because Article 47 of the Philippine Revised Penal Code
required automatic review by the Supreme Court of all death sentences, a
particularly high proportion of these cases were those in which lower
courts had recommended execution.[^^[511]^^](#_ftn511) With only two
exceptions however, in the cases under consideration the Supreme Court
reduced all death sentences of affirmed verdicts, usually to *reclusion
perpetua*, an indeterminate sentence of 20 to 40 years of imprisonment
together with a lifelong sentence of civil
interdiction.[^^[512]^^](#_ftn512)

 For years after the defeat of Japan, the Supreme Court was an awkward
institution to deliberate upon the issue of collaboration. Five of its
11 early postwar members had served in the occupation government in some
capacity, and three of its members, Ramon Ozaeta, Ricardo Paras, and
Manuel V. Moran had served on the Supreme Court in the wartime
republic.[^^[513]^^](#_ftn513) Jose Yulo first filled the shoes of the
executed Chief Justice Jose Abad Santos, but Moran soon followed him and
continued to serve as Chief Justice into the postwar until his
retirement in 1951.[^^[514]^^](#_ftn514) While their service in the
office undoubtedly contributed an air of legitimacy to the judiciary
under the Japanese occupation and they had ample opportunity to continue
their close relationships with other leading wartime political
collaborators, it would be unfair to suggest that these men used their
office to provide direct judicial backing for Japanese or Constabulary
repression of the resistance. Instead, the wartime Supreme Court
justices kept themselves busy with relatively trivial matters while the
war raged around them. In the *Official Gazette* of the wartime Republic
from October, 1943 to June, 1944 there are only 27 Supreme Court
decisions listed. Of these, all but one of the cases were economic in
nature, involving inheritance, land transactions, the repayment of
loans, and the illegal use of trademarks. To give but one example, in
February 1944, the Supreme Court ruled on whether or not the Secretary
of Labour could compel the operator of a rice mill to repair an engine
which vibrated so severely that it shook the foundations of the
building. The only case which came close to the violence of war was a
May 1944 decision affirming the conviction in a conspiracy to murder
committed by a group of “socialists.”[^^[515]^^](#_ftn515) While
Japanese military and constabulary were busy torturing and executing any
captured “socialist” Hukbalahap guerrillas, the Supreme Court under the
Japanese ruled on this single case against four defendants who had been
convicted of a crime that took place in July 1940, more than a year
*before* the Japanese arrived.

 In the postwar period the Supreme Court would retain a role as the
final arbiter of state retribution in a host of violent crimes. However,
the slow moving legal machine of the Philippines that culminated in
their rulings would continue to work side-by-side with other legal and
extralegal forms of political retribution. At the same time the Supreme
Court was handing down rulings on leading cases of military
collaboration and atrocities committed by traitors, a new rebellion by
the most powerful wartime guerrillas, the Hukbalahap, was brewing on the
plains of Luzon. Summary justice in the field, which reigned on all
sides during the Japanese occupation, or in special military courts,
together created an expansive space for violence against and by
insurgents that has continued, not only during the occupation and early
postwar but, to a greater or lesser degree, down to the present day.

*Complex Crimes*

 In almost all of its rulings on wartime treason cases, the Supreme
Court corrected judges of the People’s Court or courts of first instance
which combined allegations of treason with murder or other violent
crimes. Lower courts frequently ruled that military collaborators,
informers, and spies were guilty of treason on the one hand and
separately of violent crimes on the other. When combined as “complex
crimes” as defined by Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code of the
Philippines, conviction guaranteed that the maximum penalty for the
heavier crime would be given, which helps account for a large number of
death sentences handed down. Thus, a military collaborator who joined a
Japanese patrol and, say, beat or tortured an individual or robbed
suspected guerrillas or, if convicted of the “complex crime,”
automatically given the maximum penalty for treason, a death sentence.

The Supreme Court rejected this argument in case after case, usually
referring to the precedent established by *People vs. Prieto*, a ruling
issued the very day after the amnesty for political collaborators, on
January 29, 1948.[^^[516]^^](#_ftn516) In this case, Eduardo Prieto was
accused of being an agent of the Japanese military police who
participated in raids on suspected guerrillas, tortured suspects,
himself bayonetted two guerrillas to death and also murdered a third.
The lower court ruled that the accused was guilty of “the crime of
treason complexed by murder and physical injuries” and sentenced him to
death. Rejecting this compounding of the crime the Supreme Court
described the crime of treason in this way:

The execution of some of the guerrilla suspects mentioned in these
counts and the infliction of physical injuries on others are not
offenses separate from treason…In the nature of things, the giving of
aid and comfort can only be accomplished by some kind of action. Its
very nature partakes of a deed or physical activity as opposed to a
mental operation. (Cramer vs. U.S., ante.) This deed or physical
activity may be, and often is, in itself a criminal offense under
another penal statute or provision. Even so, when the deed is charged as
an element of treason it becomes identified with the latter crime and
can not be the subject of a separate punishment, or used in combination
with treason to increase the penalty…[^^[517]^^](#_ftn517)

 In other words, in the context of an enemy occupation, assuming that
adherence to the enemy could be demonstrated, the murder of a guerrilla
is not murder but treason. It is not a traitor who commits the killing
but a murder that makes the traitor. Besides the fact that a complex
crime would have guaranteed the harshest punishment, this ruling could
be beneficial to the accused in other ways. Whereas a murder case
required only a single credible witness to convict, murder which
constituted treason required two. It also ensured that the, “factual
complexity of the crime of treason does not endow it with the functional
ability of worm multiplication or amoeba
reproduction.”[^^[518]^^](#_ftn518) For example, it prevented a suspect
of being convicted of treason for providing aid and comfort to the enemy
by accompanying soldiers on a raid and then being convicted of a
separate count of murder should the expedition have resulted in the
death of any guerrillas.

Seen from the perspective of victim’s call for justice, however, not
only did the ruling make it more difficult to secure convictions due to
the two witness rule, but the political nature of the offense came to
dominate the arguments of the court. In each case, it was just as
important, from a legal standpoint, to establish that the accused, in
violation of a “duty of allegiance,” and “for the purpose and with the
intent of giving aid and comfort to the enemy, did willfully,
unlawfully, feloniously and traitorously” carry out each act, rather
than to establish all the details of the violence itself since adherence
to Japan was as crucial to conviction as the overt act itself. In the
political crime of treason the primary victim is the nation, and only
particular brutality shown in a killing, rather than a “less painful
method of execution” could serve as an aggravating circumstance to
increase the penalty.[^^[519]^^](#_ftn519)

Treason was not the only political crime where “worm multiplication” was
prevented. The related crime of rebellion, that is, “rising publicly and
taking arms against the Government for the purpose of removing from the
allegiance to said Government or its laws,” came to be handled by the
Supreme Court in the same manner in what is today known in the
Philippines as the “Hernandez Doctrine” after the case which established
the precedent. When it is successfully argued, the Hernandez Doctrine
protects radical dissidents from an endless compounding of more minor
offenses when accused of rebellion. It had its most notable
implementation in trying the captured leadership of the Huk rebellion.
Together with other leading Huk rebels, Jose Lava, a former head of the
Communist Party of the Philippines and political leader of the uprising
from 1948-1950, was convicted with “the complex crime of rebellion with
murders and arsons.” Lava was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* but many
of his fellow accused Huks were sentenced to death thanks to the
“complex” nature of their crime. When the case reached the Supreme Court
in 1969, it ruled the murders were political acts that themselves
constituted the crime of rebellion, in accordance with the earlier
Hernandez precedent, and reduced all of their sentences to between 5 and
10 years.[^^[520]^^](#_ftn520)

In the broader historical terms of an international conflict, however,
the earlier rulings on *murder as treason* detached the act from both
its common criminal context, and also distinguished it from the kind of
acts commonly committed by armed parties on all sides in war up to that
time. Instead, its separate category confirmed the widespread domestic
sentiments in recently liberated countries around the world in the
aftermath of World War II that, during an occupation, there were in fact
three different kinds of murder: killing for personal motives, killing
for the cause of freedom, and treasonous murder. This may seem to be an
obvious and natural division but it is radically different from a
contemporaneous approach to wartime violence based on the laws of war,
either in the decades leading up to World War II, or within the scope of
the new “crimes against humanity” prosecuted by the war crime courts of
Nuremberg, Tokyo, and elsewhere. Within the relatively weak
international legal environment created by the 1899 and 1907 Hague
conventions and the 1929 Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of
Prisoners of War, violence against those under the control of an
occupier was classified according to the status of the victim:
recognized belligerents treated as prisoners of war after capture,
non-combatants, and unlawful combatants who were, in the absence of any
explicit protections, generally subject to military justice, the speed
and severity of which not only varied widely from conflict to conflict
and army to army, but often showed a lack of consistency within them.

As in treason cases in other countries, however, no attempt was made by
the Philippine courts to make a distinction between the war crime of
killing innocent civilians and the execution of spies and guerrillas
whose lives had never been effectively protected by international
law.[^^[521]^^](#_ftn521) In the 1907 Hague Convention as well as the
third Geneva Convention of 1949 which explicitly banned, for the first
time, reprisal killings against civilians, guerrillas could only claim
protection as prisoners of war when they had, among other requirements,
a “fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance,” carried their
arms openly, and conducted their operations, “in accordance with the
laws and customs of war.”[^^[522]^^](#_ftn522) Even after a further
expansion of protections in 1977, these stipulations have continued to
effectively shield states, including the United States, who abused or
killed “unlawful combatants” down to the present
day.[^^[523]^^](#_ftn523) The Philippine Supreme Court revealed on at
least one occasion that they had no sympathy for this kind of
restrictive definition, when they affirmed the conviction a member of
the secret service division of the Manila metropolitan police who
suggested the laws of war protected his work crushing the underground
movement in the city. Even if the issue of treason were set aside, the
unlawful nature of Manila insurgents was not conceded, “while guerrilla
warfare may be unlawful from the standpoint of the conqueror, it cannot
be so regarded by those who, by natural right, are trying to drive him
out of their invaded territory.”[^^[524]^^](#_ftn524)

War crimes courts were often more forgiving. When a Japanese soldier
executed a guerrilla in the Philippines, as long as he followed some
minimal form of military justice, he could effectively argue he was not
committing a war crime but following an established practice of war, an
argument upheld in the Nuremberg trial of German officers such as
General William List and others.[^^[525]^^](#_ftn525) In this infamous
“Hostages Trial,” best remembered for the convoluted precedent it
established on the limited legality of reprisal killings, the execution
of thousands of partisans by the accused in Greece and Yugoslavia were
ruled, with somewhat less ambiguity, to not be a war crime. The judges
conceded that, “We are obliged to hold that such guerrillas were *francs
tireurs* who, upon capture, could be subjected to the death
penalty.”[^^[526]^^](#_ftn526) On the other hand, as in similar cases
around the world, when, for example, a Makapili soldier executed a
guerrilla under Japanese orders, he was guilty, by accident of birth, of
the capital offense of treason.

*Bureau of Constabulary Officers On Trial*

 The rehabilitation of the BoC began even before Japanese surrender.
Many of the thousands of officers who deserted the Japanese in the fall
of 1944 joined USAFFE (U.S. Army Forces Far East) affiliated guerrillas
whenever possible. Unlike the Burma National Army, however, this
reversal—or “coming out”—of loyalty happened at the level of individual
officers or small-scale units rather than the organization as a whole.
Before the People’s Courts were established the difficult task of
determining the “true loyalties” of BoC officers who had returned to the
fold had already been confronted by special “loyalty boards” which
screened each BoC officer beginning in the summer of 1945 and found but
few wanting.[^^[527]^^](#_ftn527) Many of those who passed, now armed
with counterinsurgency experience gained under the Japanese, continued
to serve in the Military Police Command, which was soon given, once
again, the name Philippine Constabulary in 1948. The rehabilitation of
the wartime organization seemed complete when its most prominent
surviving head, Guillermo Francisco, was found not guilty on all counts
of treason after the war. Despite a mountain of evidence brought against
him and over half a dozen witnesses, the two witness rule for each
individual treasonous act and the carefully vague designation of the
constabulary’s targets as “bandits or lawless elements” helped him
overcome all 22 counts even before the passing of the
amnesty.[^^[528]^^](#_ftn528)

 Although they were not explicitly exempted in the 1948 amnesty, the
Supreme Court further confirmed the rehabilitation of the BoC when it
established a precedent in 1949 that membership in the organization was
not by itself treason. Jose de Castro, a former soldier who had fought
for the United States in the USAFFE before joining the BoC, was
convicted of treason by the Fifth Division of the People's Court partly
on the basis of his BoC membership.[^^[529]^^](#_ftn529) However, Castro
was acquitted of all charges by the Supreme Court which ruled that,
“Membership in the Bureau of Constabulary under the government of
occupation is not treason. That institution was intended for the
promotion and preservation of law and order which were essential during
war to the life of the civilian population.”[^^[530]^^](#_ftn530) Thus,
the decision by the Japanese to merge the BoC with the local police may
have been a blow to what little prestige its officers might have felt
when they joined the organization out of POW camps but it was now of
help to them when they faced treason charges. The key was, of course,
the identity of these “bandits and lawless elements” the Constabulary
were so busy suppressing were. Hilario Felipe, a peasant reform leader
and later Huk officer from Talavera in central Luzon, told the graduate
student Benedict J. Kerkvliet in 1970 that the Hukbalahap resistance was
widely respected not just for attacking the Japanese occupiers but in
reducing crime in the rural areas because, “there wasn’t anyone else
doing it during the occupation.” The Bureau of Constabulary were,
“chasing guerrillas, not carabao thieves.”[^^[531]^^](#_ftn531) Other
American led guerrillas who waged a savage war with the Huks in the same
area of Luzon, however, were far more sympathetic to the Constabulary,
who supplied them with arms, agreed to restrict patrols in their areas
of control, and were thoroughly infiltrated by guerrillas for
intelligence collection.[^^[532]^^](#_ftn532) The picture that emerges
is thus much like the one which existed in large parts of Japanese
occupied China, where Japanese allied Chinese military forces in rural
areas could be found aggressively suppressing Communist guerrillas on
the one hand, while entering into a truce or active cooperation with
other guerrilla forces who often owed allegiance to the
Nationalists.[^^[533]^^](#_ftn533) In both places there existed a
violent arena in which patriotism and national betrayal were less useful
than class and institutional loyalties in predicting alignments.
According to Kerkvliet’s informants in Luzon, before the Japanese
occupation the Constabulary was, “practically an army for the landed
elites.” It is hardly surprising to find it continuing to clash
violently with the strongest guerrilla movement in the area, whose rural
component had deep roots in the peasant reform
movement.[^^[534]^^](#_ftn534)

Although the Supreme Court overturned People’s Court convictions on the
basis of BoC membership, the court was nevertheless willing to evaluate
charges of treasonous acts by BoC officers on a case-by-case basis. As
Chief Justice Moran put it in affirming the conviction of Bernabe Galo,
who had joined Japanese and other Bureau of Constabulary officers in the
arrest and torture of several guerrillas in 1943 and 1944 in western
Luzon, the “Appellant's membership in the police force of Manaoag does
not in itself constitute treason; but his having accompanied the
Japanese soldiers to the places of abode of guerrilla leaders and the
several illtreatments which he personally inflicted upon them because of
their refusal to disclose their connection with the guerrilla forces,
constitute treason.”[^^[535]^^](#_ftn535) From the perspective of Huks
who were targeted by BoC raids throughout the occupation and continued
to fight them when this ruling was handed down in 1949, the act of
“accompanying Japanese soldiers to the places of abode of guerrillas,”
was hardly more than a basic job description for the Constabulary. In
none of the BoC cases, or other Supreme Court treason rulings on Luzon
cases, are the guerrillas targeted for arrest, torture, and execution
ever identified as connected to the Huks. However, because the
organizational affiliations of guerrillas mentioned in these cases were
rarely clarified, this fact is not sufficient evidence the courts
ignored raids by military collaborators on the Hukbalahap. In Galo’s
case, the tortured guerrillas may have been attached to Ray Hunt’s
units, which were active in the Manaoag area, and which were in turn
under command of a leading American guerrilla, Major Robert
Lapham.[^^[536]^^](#_ftn536) In this case, not only had the accused thus
pitted his Constabulary against guerrilla forces that were known for
having established amicable relations with units of the BoC, but the
guerrilla leader he arrested, Tomas Velasquez, was the pre-war police
chief of Manaoag.[^^[537]^^](#_ftn537)

The conviction of Gaudencio Roble also shows that the Luzon based Huks
were not the only target for some Constabulary units. The Supreme Court
affirmed Roble’s conviction in 1949 for three counts of having led BoC
units in the arrest of guerrillas in Cebu, at least one of which was a
former USAFFE soldier, tortured those who were captured, and executed
those who survived interrogation.[^^[538]^^](#_ftn538) In several cases,
however, the Supreme Court overturned rulings of the lower court when it
failed to persuade them that the BoC were truly acting on behalf of the
Japanese cause. Policarpio Dumapit, a BoC officer in Zambales, was
convicted of having arrested, tortured and imprisoned eight guerrillas
in 1943 and issuing an order to capture all Americans roaming in the
forest, dead or alive. However, the Supreme Court dismissed the
conviction in 1949. The majority ruling justified the acquittal by
arguing that only three of the eight victims testified for the
prosecution and two of these admitted they were being investigated for
arson. The fact they served their sentence in a provincial jail rather
than a military garrison, argued the court, suggested they were not
suspected guerrillas but common criminals. In the case of the order to
capture or kill all Americans, the Supreme Court believed the accused
when he claimed to have told the tribal leader to ignore the written
order when he delivered it. They were further persuaded that the accused
only entered the Constabulary with the knowledge and acquiescence of
local guerrillas, who referred to him as “Ave
Maria.”[^^[539]^^](#_ftn539) In a dissenting opinion Justice Tuason
protested that the Supreme Court was in no position to question the
credibility of various witnesses at such a distance and was convinced of
the officer’s guilt. In justifying his dissent, however, he brought in
evidence from other counts of treason which lower courts had already
dismissed due to the two witness rule. Quoting various witnesses who
reported on the role of the accused in the capture of two Americans who
were later killed, and sending of letters urging guerrillas to
surrender, Tuason concluded, “if he burned candles for both sides, his
true longing was for the devil. He feigned connection and sympathy with
the guerrillas as a means of protection to himself if and when the day
of judgment arrived.”

The appeal of Benjamin Nadurata shows again how complex the cases which
the Supreme Court ruled upon could get as it evaluated the contradictory
testimony emerging from the lower courts.[^^[540]^^](#_ftn540) Nadurata
was chief of police in Caloocan, Rizal before the war but was sent for
further training to the Constabulary Academy set up by the Japanese in
1942. He was convicted of treason for the arrest, torture, and death of
three suspected guerrillas in southern Luzon. Several witnesses
testified to various components of the charges including the torture
after the arrest, the leaving of one suspect tied to a post under the
heat of the sun, and how three arrested guerrillas were taken to the top
of a mountain for execution. After the first was killed, a second was
shot while trying run away and the third, who survived a shot through
the neck and face, was thrown into a pit and left to die. Miraculously,
this third victim survived and testified at the treason trial as to his
arrest, the interrogation which questioned him about his connection to
two guerrilla leaders, and the attempt to kill him on the mountain. The
Supreme Court, however, was more inclined to believe the testimony of
the accused who claimed that, as Albay provincial commander of the BoC,
Nadurata was acting on orders of the provincial governor to prevent rice
from leaving the province even as he secretly provided supplies to
legitimate guerrillas. After a warehouse of rice had been raided he set
out with 50 of his Constabulary men to arrest those responsible and the
three victims were found to be members of a gang, under one Anatolio
Llenerizas, who were suspected of having launched the attack. The
governor of the province testified that Llenerizas was not a respected
guerrilla leader in the province but led feared bandits who “robbed and
killed people on the highways.” The three victims were shot, claimed
Nadurata and one of his subordinates, while “trying to escape” when they
were guiding the BoC to the headquarters of Llenerizas. The court
acquitted the defendant, and did not address at all the question of the
torture of the victims.

The Supreme Court was itself ruling on the veracity of testimony from a
distance, and it is often impossible for a historian to evaluate the
merits of complex cases. It was indeed common to find bandits claiming
to be guerrillas and guerrillas behaving as common bandits, not only
throughout the Philippines, but under military occupations everywhere.
However, it is interesting to note that, in this case, the judges
rejected the testimony of no less than five witnesses for the
prosecution, including a victim who had been shot through the face and
neck—questioning their honesty and pointing out contradictions—while
accepting, without any challenge, testimony of the defense from the
accused, his subordinate BoC officer and the Japanese appointed
provincial governor. In case after case of Makapili or other informers,
the Supreme Court would roundly dismiss the testimony of any witnesses
who were in a similarly compromised position as a collaborator or had
some other close connection to the accused. For example, in the Makapili
trial of Primitivo Osi, the court dismissed the testimony of Osi and two
witnesses (one of them a relative of the accused), not because of any
specific problem of their testimony, but due to the weight of
prosecuting witnesses. Additionally, they noted, “it is well established
in the law of evidence that affirmative testimony is stronger than
negative.”[^^[541]^^](#_ftn541)

 The same generosity of interpretation can be found in the court’s
ruling in the appeal of Vicente Tumandao, which the People’s Court had
sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* after being found guilty on five out
of eighteen counts of treason. One of the counts, based solely on his
membership in the Bureau of Constabulary could be easily dismissed based
on the above-mentioned precedent. All the other counts, however, were
for leading patrols to arrest suspected guerrillas or former USAFFE
soldiers and in one case, when failing to find the target, for taking a
whole family as hostage to a Japanese garrison. The accused himself
testified that he was ordered to join fifteen Japanese soldiers, five
other constabulary officers, two interpreters and an informer on a raid
that resulted in eight arrests. As we have seen, judges ruled elsewhere
that this act alone would have been sufficient grounds for a treason
conviction. In this case, however, they were “impressed with the
frankness of the appellant” in admitting that he joined the raids.
Justice Paras revealed the depth of sympathy the court had for these
Constabulary men who entered their new profession straight out of a
starving prisoner of war camp such as Camp O’Donnell in Capas:

It is hard to believe that the appellant, who had rendered splendid
service in Bataan and fresh from the risks and hardships that were his
in Capas would readily much less voluntarily, have allowed himself to
become a willing tool of his former was enemies. Upon the other hand, we
are inclined to think that he had no choice in the matter. Indeed, we
know as a matter of public notoriety that the Filipino soldiers released
in Capas endeavored to enter in the government service in any capacity
in to the Japanese army or being suspected as hostile to the military
occupants…As there is also no showing that the appellant had previous
knowledge of the guerrilla connection of those whose relatives were
arrested and detained, it is not safe to assume that the raids charged
in the information were made at his initiative or instigation. We rather
think that appellant's role in the incidents complained of served to
frustrate the barbarous ways of the Japanese if the latter were allowed
to run the whole show.[^^[542]^^](#_ftn542)

Again Justice Tuason wrote a dissenting opinion in which he listed the
various examples of how beatings personally administered by the
defendant in the course of interrogations were hardly examples of him
attempting to “frustrate the barbarous ways of the Japanese.” On the
contrary, he was shocked that someone who had himself undergone the
horrors of Japanese custody could partake in these acts. As Tuason saw
it, each POW released and sent into Constabulary service had three
choices: evade service, join but restrict conduct to preserving law and
order, or treasonously assist in suppressing the resistance. However, he
did not concede the extreme difficulty in distinguishing between the
latter two choices when Constabulary units found themselves on joint
patrols or raids with the Japanese.

*Accused Makapili on Trial*

In Constabulary treason cases determining adherence to the enemy was the
biggest challenge for any prosecutor. As in the case of political
collaborators, psychological factors were important. This was not the
case for the Makapili. Although a high percentage of cases involving
Yōin, Coastal Defense Corps, and various auxiliaries also resulted in
affirmed convictions, membership in the Makapili was alone sufficient
grounds for a treason conviction.[^^[543]^^](#_ftn543) The precedent
usually cited for this was the 1947 case *People v. Manayao*. Unlike
other accused members of the organization who claimed to be the most
dedicated of super patriots fighting against imperialism, Pedro Manayao
claimed in this case that, as a Makapili, he had joined the Japanese
Imperial Army, sworn allegiance to Japan, and was therefore no longer a
Filipino citizen. The court dismissed this argument in the simplest of
terms, “We are of the considered opinion that the *Makapili*, although
organized to render military aid to the Japanese Army in the Philippines
during the late war, was not a part of said army. It was an organization
of Filipino traitors, pure and simple.”[^^[544]^^](#_ftn544)

These were the extremely violent days of late 1944 and early 1945, after
Japanese reinforcements flooded in, guerrilla attacks ramped up, and
American forces returned to the archipelago. Manayao’s institutional
affiliation or even his citizenship seems hardly the issue worth
quibbling over given the nature of the violence that followed. The
timing is key. Constabulary forces predominantly joined Japanese patrols
and raids from mid-1942 to mid-1944 and while there were regional
upsurges in violence where Japanese military carried out large scale
mopping up campaigns, such as in Leyte around October, 1943, the
Constabulary was on the other side of the violence of the early 1942
invasion and had mostly abandoned its posts when the violence peaked
again in late 1944. The Makapili certainly “adhered to the enemy,” but
even if some of its members genuinely desired—as surely many
Constabulary officers who joined Japanese raids did—to minimize civilian
deaths, they came into being at a moment when the cycle of violence in
Luzon, where they were most active, had reached its most horrible stage
of mass reprisals. In some cases, however, such as that of Pedro
Manayao, witnesses testified that the cruelty of these military
collaborators far outstripped that of the Japanese soldiers they
accompanied. In late January, 1945, as American troops were about to
begin retaking Manila, guerrillas launched an attack on occupation
forces in Angat, in the province of Bulacan. In reprisal for the attack,
Japanese soldiers, together with Manayao and other Makapilis, took
revenge upon the nearby barrio of Banaban. The men, women, and children
of the village were gathered together and, with the exception of the
children, all sixty or seventy of them were slaughtered. Two young
survivors who were spared testified that the Japanese soldiers stopped
the Makapili Manayao, who was a local known by his nickname ‘Pedro, the
Painter,’ from killing the children as well, at which he allegedly
protested that, “the children would be wives of guerrillas later when
they grew up.”[^^[545]^^](#_ftn545)

The conviction of Florentino Canibas by the Supreme Court in 1950 was
for an even more horrible massacre. On February 11, 1945 a group of
Makapilis together with Japanese soldiers raided the barrio Marajuy in
Lipa, Batangas province. Several hundred people, almost the entire
population including men, women and children were marched to a citrus
experimental station, tied in groups of two and
bayoneted.[^^[546]^^](#_ftn546) Five girls were spared to be kept as
“servants” of the attackers, one of which testified as one of the three
main witnesses for the prosecution.[^^[547]^^](#_ftn547) In a separate
case which reached the Supreme Court in 1952, Macario Bautro was
convicted for participating in the same massacre, raising the sentence
of the lower court of 12 years and 1 day, on the basis of his “lack of
education,” to *reclusion perpetua* given the seriousness of the
crime.[^^[548]^^](#_ftn548) Not all reprisal raids that involved alleged
Makapili members ended in massacre, but this was hardly comforting to
inhabitants of a community in the midst of an attack. The Supreme Court
affirmed a conviction against Juan Lansanas for having joined a patrol
of Japanese soldiers on a reprisal raid which resulted in the arrest and
detention of all males in the targeted village in Laguna province for
three days in December, 1944. The raid followed the discovery of the
corpse of a Makapili member and the refusal of the village to point out
who had killed him.

In both the cases of Canibas and Lansanas, lower courts had also
convicted them of a separate count of membership in the Makapili.
Although both were seen wearing a “Japanese uniform” and a “white
armband” in the company of the Japanese—something which could have
described a range of auxiliaries voluntary or coerced—the Supreme Court
dismissed this charge in both cases for lack of two witnesses to any
overt act confirming official membership. Instead, it used this evidence
in the charge to confirm the adherence to the enemy required to convert
other acts of violence into treason. The court came to the same
conclusion in other cases, such as those of Filemon Escleto, Ismael
Aquivido, and Domingo Capacete, whose conviction by lower courts also
included separate treason counts alleging
membership.[^^[549]^^](#_ftn549) In other cases, such as that of
Alejandro Almazora and Valentin Trinidad Bagalawis, the court inferred
membership from circumstances confirmed by at least two witnesses, such
as the existence of a local Makapili branch, and the accused being seen
at its headquarters frequently associating with its well-known
members.[^^[550]^^](#_ftn550) Nevertheless, the court had come to
recognize that that the term Makapili was used quite broadly. Testimony
in the Lansanas case revealed what it had come to mean from the
perspective of villagers, “The witness heard from people that the
Makapilis were the persons who were always in company of the Japanese
pointing out guerrillas.”[^^[551]^^](#_ftn551) In only a relatively
small minority of cases was membership in the organization as clear as
it was in, for example, that of Jose Javier Almodovar, who admitted in a
statement given to a U.S. Counter Intelligence officer that he joined
the Makapili in Novevember, 1944 after hearing Benigno Ramos, Artemio
Ricarte and Pio Duran deliver recruitment speeches in Santa Rosa, Laguna
province.[^^[552]^^](#_ftn552)

In most of the cases, the accused Makapili appear as armed individuals
accompanying Japanese patrols or raids. The previously mentioned case of
Primitivo Osi, however, offers both a look at the often long
relationship of an alleged Makapili officer with the Japanese, and the
development of the organization into one with a more recognizably
military character.[^^[553]^^](#_ftn553) Osi was, like many other
accused Makapili, formerly a member of Sakdalista party from 1930-1935,
serving as a party secretary in Candelaria, in what is now Quezon
province, and also worked in the Manila Electric Company as a lighting
inspector. In October, 1944 he accepted a job as a foreman and
interpreter for the Japanese manager of a Japanese company identified as
“Mataichi Kabushi Kaisha” but known by its prewar incarnation as the
government founded Nacoco (National Coconut
Corporation).[^^[554]^^](#_ftn554) A number of witnesses testified that
he drilled and commanded “*Makapili* soldiers of the *Nacoco* Military
Police” numbering between 300 and 400 Filipinos, which were
headquartered at in the Nacoco garrison. In his own testimony denying
all the accusations of atrocities, Osi said he had “drilled the
laborers” of the company and that they all eventually retreated with the
Japanese. Prosecution witnesses accused Osi of leading Makapili,
sometimes in the company of Japanese but other times making no mention
of them, in the confiscation of food supplies, the arrest of numerous
suspected guerrillas who never returned to their homes, the mass burning
of homes, and of participating in the massacre of 50 bound captives in a
foxhole near the garrison. While the term Makapili is used throughout
the details of the ruling, the question of official membership and the
actual existence of any formal Makapili unit was not considered in the
Supreme Court ruling. If the accused was at least telling the truth when
he claimed to have drilled laborers of the company, instead of the image
of a band of 300 to 400 rabidly pro-Japanese Makapili recruits bent on
destruction, this may be an example of one of the many small-scale and
less formal local efforts by the Japanese to train and arm Filipinos who
were already employed by an institution run by the occupiers. Of course,
this would not alter the facts of extreme violence and atrocities
carried out by those involved, but serve as another reminder that the
patterns of this violence are closely tied to the contexts of particular
times and places, rather than neatly assigned to particular institutions
and their ideology.

*Magic Eyes and Finger Pointers on Trial*

In most cases involving informers, an “agent of the military police” or
someone fulfilling some other vaguely described position, was described
as assisting Japanese soldiers to identify one or a few specific
suspected guerrillas, usually known to the informer. Typical is the case
of Apolonio Carlos who, in the summer of 1944, was seen getting out of a
truck with some Japanese soldiers in a neighborhood of Manila and
pointing out two houses.[^^[555]^^](#_ftn555) Three individuals were
taken from these homes by the soldiers to Fort Santiago where they were
tortured during interrogation and released about a week later. The
motives of Carlos were not considered by the Supreme Court and the
appeal made no claim that the accused was acting under duress, so the
court affirmed the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*. These cases usually
depict a common counterinsurgency scenario: soldiers and their
informants hunting down a series of known or suspected guerrillas, whose
names may have been obtained through the interrogation and torture of
already captured individuals. The informers might be a recently tortured
prisoner, an intimidated local community member, a hostile neighbor
willing to help the Japanese settle a score, or more regular informants
who knew the local area well. While these raids on individual homes
could be terrifying and involve extreme violence both at the scene of
capture and once the targets had been taken back to the garrison, the
zoning of an entire district or village, especially when combined with
anonymous masked informers, produced a uniquely communal experience of
horror.

 The hooded “Magic eye” have since become closely associated with the
Makapili, but the two are rarely equated in the case files. The Makapili
appear as armed, sometimes uniformed, and occasionally on horseback
directly engaged in attacks and arrests. The “magic eye” informers do,
however, make a terrifying appearance in a number of treason cases,
occasionally side by side with those identified as Makapili and, like
the majority of treason cases that reached the Supreme Court, usually
from the same violent period in the last months of the war. A typical
case is found in the prosecution of Faustino Flores, Leon Gutierrez, and
Felipe Reyes:

Early in the morning of December 1, 1944, a mixed force of Japanese
soldiers and Filipinos, the latter armed with rifles and revolvers and
each wearing a white band across his chest, rounded up the male
residents of the different sitios of the barrio of Tipas, herded them
together at the town plaza and then made them pass single file in front
of a house located at one corner of the plaza. At the window of this
house were several hooded persons known in those days as "magic eyes"
who, as the men passed before them, indicted by a nod the ones suspected
of being guerrillas. These were then led to the Aglipayan church where
they were subjected to tortures to make them admit their guerilla
affiliation and [squeal] on the other guerilla suspects. Some of them
were even hanged from trees and the rafters of nearby houses. At about 5
o'clock in the afternoon of that day, the suspects were loaded in trucks
and taken to Fort Santiago in Manila, many of them never to
return.[^^[556]^^](#_ftn556)

Other accused Makapili, however, directly joined in the process of
zoning and identifying guerrillas, although in a less anonymous fashion.
Ismael Aquivido, wearing a “Japanese cap with visor” stood at the
entrance of a church in San Pablo City where all males 15 to 50 years of
age had been gathered. As the men passed out of the church, he tapped
“at least seventy” of the men on the back, who, “were taken over by the
Japanese soldiers and later massacred.”[^^[557]^^](#_ftn557)

“Finger pointers,” as they were also called, could also be women. In
January 1950 the Supreme Court affirmed the treason conviction of
Arsenia Nuñez, who was accused of being a “finger pointer” during two
zonings in July, 1944.[^^[558]^^](#_ftn558) After her husband allegedly
abandoned her she moved from her home barrio to Cavite City, “where, in
consonance with he[r] loose morals, particularly during the Japanese
occupation, she became the mistress of Magno Garcia, a Japanese mestizo
and a notorious spy in the service of the Japanese Kempei-tai in
Cavite.”[^^[559]^^](#_ftn559) She returned, at an age “over 15 and under
18 years” to participate in the zoning of her barrio with several
truckloads of Japanese soldiers. There, “wearing a Japanese cap and
clothing similar to that worn by Japanese soldiers” she pointed out two
men who she said were, “bad men and guerrillas.” The two were taken away
and never seen again. Witnesses for the prosecution also testified she
participated in another zoning of another nearby district were she
pointed out another five men.

The accused offered a much more complicated story in her defense. In her
version of the events Nuñez was kidnapped by a group of armed bandits
known as “Texas” that included a rejected suitor Ceferino Portuguez, who
then raped her. She was then left in a house which was subsequently
raided by Japanese soldiers, who refused to believe that she had been
kidnapped and raped. She was taken by the soldiers to the city and
placed in the custody of Magno Garcia, who she admitted living with
until the liberation of the Philippines. She did confess to having
participated in the zoning of her own barrio but claimed the men she
pointed out in the zoning included her rapist, Portuguez. The court was
not persuaded. Testimony of the father of Nuñez showing “utter
indifference” about his daughter’s alleged kidnapping was “so unnatural,
so contrary to the well-known strength and closeness of the family ties
of the Filipinos, that we hardly believe the accuracy of this story” and
the court was inclined to believe the four women who testified for the
prosecution since it was, “unbelievable that they would have concocted
such accusations against this appellant, one of their own sex, if the
facts related by them on the witness stand were mere fabrications.”
Justice Torres concluded the majority opinion, “even assuming that her
contention that she was criminally assaulted and kidnapped by the
‘Texas’ bandits is true, yet, we fail to understand how such acts could
justify her treasonable acts and adherence to the enemies of her country
and fellow citizens.” Due to her young age, the Supreme Court reduced
the sentence for Nuñez from *reclusion perpetua* to 10 years, but she
was freed with many of the other convicted traitors in 1953.

Nuñez was not the only woman to have come before the People’s Court, but
was one of the rare women who were convicted. Ma. Florina Yamsuan Orilos
has identified at least 130 women in the papers of the People’s Court
and examined some 65 of these cases detail, almost all of which resulted
in dismissal of the charges.[^^[560]^^](#_ftn560) The largest number of
these cases, 25, involved women who were, like Nuñez, charged with being
informers or spies.[^^[561]^^](#_ftn561) Others were accused of being
members of the Makapili, propaganda agents, or of economic
collaboration. Some of them were accused of nothing more than serving as
cooks or doing laundry, but all of these cases were dismissed.

**Figure 1: CIC Interrogation of Filipina, 1944\
 \
**

              The image of one suspected female collaborator is
preserved in a history of Counter Intelligence Corps operations in the
Southwest Pacific. The suspect, who is described as the “common law
wife” of a Japanese military police sergeant, is portrayed reclining in
a relaxed cross-legged pose while the CIC officer sits nearby,
diligently recording answers to questions about her alleged involvement
in the execution of an American officer.[^^[562]^^](#_ftn562) While
there are bars on the window, and the crime is deadly serious, the scene
captured or more likely staged for the photographer strangely contrasts
the casual disposition of the accused with the professionalism of a CIC
officer working what appear to be cramped conditions. Whether the
suspect was accused of helping expose or capture the executed officer,
or was perhaps merely present at his execution, her name does not appear
on the list of those pardoned in 1953 or among the appeals cases that
reached the Supreme Court.

              While the photographed CIC suspect was accused of having a
connection to a violent outcome, seven women were accused in People’s
Court proceedings of having providing aid and comfort to the enemy by
serving as mistresses or concubines of the Japanese and one woman Amparo
Karagdag, mistress of the head of military police in the Philippines,
Nagahama Akira, was accused of being an informer, spy and a mistress.
The People’s Court dismissed the case in 1946, “it was more of a
question of disloyalty to her husband than disloyalty to her
country.”[^^[563]^^](#_ftn563) Orilos points out one of the most
remarkable treason cases, of one Emeter a Mascarenas, for allegedly
consenting to be a comfort woman for Japanese soldiers at Boac on the
island of Marinduque.[^^[564]^^](#_ftn564) The case was dropped due, not
to the problematic nature of the accusation, but because of the two
witness rule and a lack of evidence. If women could be indicted and
brought to trial, if not convicted, for their relations with the
occupier, what then of Filipino men who were guilty of sexual crimes
carried out in the course of the occupation?

*A Crime Political in Nature*

As we have seen, a collaborator's violent acts including beatings,
torture, and the massacre of civilians were considered not to be
separate crimes or “complex crimes” but to themselves be manifestations
of treason which provided aid to the enemy. In cases of rape or the
abduction of women into sexual slavery, however, majority rulings of the
Philippine Supreme Court held that neither acts constituted aid and
comfort to the enemy. Instead, they were, at most, relegated to
aggravating circumstances.

Sexual violence was a prominent feature of Japanese military conquest
throughout East and Southeast Asia, though in some cases, such as the
opening stages of the occupation of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese
command demonstrated its ability to limit its attacks on
women.[^^[565]^^](#_ftn565) By contrast, the occurrence of rape by
Japanese soldiers in the Philippines from the earliest stages of the
occupation was enough to earn the alarm of section chiefs of the
Japanese Ministry of War in February, 1942, though the 14 rapes they saw
as a “considerable” number came nowhere near the prevalence of rape
noted in accounts of the occupation.[^^[566]^^](#_ftn566) While a
constant part of the campaign of violence and fear in the
counterinsurgency campaign against guerrillas throughout the
archipelago, the widespread rapes during the battle for Manila in
February, 1945 were among many of the war crime counts at the military
tribunal of General Yamashita Tomoyuki held in the city later in the
fall of the same year, which resulted in his conviction and
execution.[^^[567]^^](#_ftn567) Attempts to reduce the spread of
venereal disease and arbitrary acts of sexual violence led to the
formation of military brothels. According to one 1943 count, over a
thousand women employed by deception and various degrees of coercion,
including many Filipinas directly abducted by Japanese troops, served in
these official 'comfort stations' while many more were taken and held as
sex slaves by small isolated army units.[^^[568]^^](#_ftn568) None of
the Japanese soldiers or civilians were tried for the operation of the
comfort women system, but the indictments of Japanese soldiers and
civilians for war crimes trials carried out by Philippine courts did
include 45 counts of rape, the third largest category of war crime
behind abuse of civilians (92 counts), and the killing of civilians
(134).[^^[569]^^](#_ftn569)

 So how did the Supreme Court deal with cases of these atrocities when
Filipino collaborators were the perpetrators or indirectly complicit?
Let us consider two cases. In March 1949, the court gave a ruling on an
appeal in the treason case of one Cucufate Adlawan.[^^[570]^^](#_ftn570)
Adlawan had been sentenced to death by a lower court for the “complex
crime of treason with murder, robbery, and rape,” in an indictment that
included 23 counts. As a member the Bureau of Constabulary from March of
1943 to May, 1945 and later in the service of the Japanese military
police, he was accused in count after count with participating in mop-up
operations against guerrillas with Japanese forces, arresting suspected
resistance members, engaging in beatings and torture that sometimes
resulted in the death of the victims, as well as the direct bayonetting
of civilians. Adlawan was also accused of stripping the wife of a
suspected guerrilla and raping several young girls during a raid in the
company of Japanese military police in August, 1944 in Cordoba, Cebu.
Staying consistent with other rulings in which the Supreme Court argued
that lower courts should not have convicted suspect of “complex crimes,”
it was ruled that Adlawan should be convicted of treason alone without
commenting explicitly on whether rape constituted one of the *acts* of
treason that were thereby merged into the crime. However, there is
reason to believe that it did not consider rape as one of the individual
treasonous acts. Citing the precedent of *People vs. Racaza,* the
unanimous ruling argued that the stripping of the wife and the rape of
the Filipino girls could be considered, “two aggravating circumstances
of unnecessary cruelty and ignominy.”[^^[571]^^](#_ftn571)

In another 1949 ruling on 14 counts of treason in the case of a Filipino
agent of the Japanese military police, Antonio Racaza, rape was again
seen only as an aggravating circumstance and not an overt act of
treason.[^^[572]^^](#_ftn572) His other violent acts, in which he
“wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and treasonably,” summarily shot,
beheaded, and strangled suspected guerrillas, tortured detainees during
interrogation, and guided Japanese soldiers on raids, constituted the
very acts of his betrayal of the nation. However, his attempt to rape a
woman who refused to offer information during a raid were explicitly
reduced to aggravating circumstances which were seen as, “deliberately
augmenting unnecessary wrongs,” without themselves constituting overt
acts of treason. In a separate opinion on the same case, Associate
Justice Gregorio Perfecto (served 1945-1949) concurred with the
conviction but argued that the attempted rape should not even be
considered an aggravating circumstance:

The attempted rape on the person of Silvina Cabellon may be considered
as ground for the prosecution of a different offense, but cannot be
considered as aggravating treason, a crime political in nature. In the
attempted rape there was nothing political and it had nothing to do with
defendant's adherence and aid to the enemy.[^^[573]^^](#_ftn573)

Though he would not repeat this argument when he joined the majority in
the Adlawan case in March, in this earlier case Justice Perfecto was
here trying to make a distinction between common crimes and the uniquely
political crime that was treason. Sexual violence in war against a
suspected guerrilla was not, he argued, like beatings, torture, or the
killing of civilians, a *political* crime that provided aid and comfort
to the enemy and therefore should play no part in a treason conviction.

 If the court held that rapes did not themselves constitute acts of
treasonous violence then neither would the abduction of women into
sexual slavery. Again, let us look at two cases. We have already met
Jose de Castro, whose membership in the Bureau of Constabulary did not,
according to the Supreme Court, itself constitute treason. Castro’s
original *reclusion perpetua* sentence was not only based on his BoC
status, however, but on the fact he joined with Japanese soldiers on a
nighttime raid on suspected guerrillas in January, 1945 in the El Pardo
suburb of Cebu. Two women who lived in the targeted house were suspected
of having a connection to guerrillas and, after being strung up by their
arms for interrogation, they were both imprisoned for several weeks.
After her release, one of the girls was again taken from her house by
Castro to the home of the Japanese sergeant, one Yoshida, who led the
raid, where he, “made some amorous advances” and, “threatened to kill
her and all the members of her family should she not consent to live
with him.”[^^[574]^^](#_ftn574) She was directed to return the following
day which she did and subsequently became the sergeant's “mistress.” The
court ruled that Castro had done “nothing serious” in bringing the girl
from her house to that of the sergeant. “It may be an aid to satisfy the
lust of a Japanese officer,” but this brand of aid to the enemy was
ruled not to be treasonous thanks to the precedent established by the
case *People vs. Perez.[^**^[575]^**^](#_ftn575)*Castro's life sentence
was overturned and he was acquitted on all
counts.[^^[576]^^](#_ftn576)**

The Philippine Supreme Court ruling in the case against Susano Perez
offers an unusually detailed justification for the position that
Philippine collaborator complicity in securing sexual slaves for the
occupation forces did not constitute acts of
treason.[^^[577]^^](#_ftn577) It also offered, a remarkable dissenting
opinion which revealed the glaring inconsistency in the court's
argument. Susano “Kid” Perez was convicted of treason by the same
People's Court that had convicted Castro and was sentenced to death. In
all six counts of treason Perez was accused of “commandeering” women to
serve as sexual slaves for Japanese officers and sometimes raping the
women himself. In some cases deception was employed, as when Perez asked
for women to testify against some accused suspect, or when he attempted
to convince a reluctant woman who had already escaped once that a
Japanese colonel merely wanted her to be his secretary. According to
testimony in the trial, the same colonel would go on to rape or enslave
more than half a dozen women provided him by Perez. In one of the
counts, Perez took a woman he had delivered to the Japanese colonel
directly from a rape encounter to an uninhabited house where he then
raped the traumatized woman himself. On other occasions, Perez abducted
women from their homes and delivered them to banquets and dances where
those who were “selected” were subsequently raped by Japanese officers
in attendance. Even nurses working in the Cebu provincial hospital were
targeted for these “invitations” at gun point.

 Perez appealed the treason conviction and its death sentence without
denying any of the findings in the accounts. In his opposing brief the
Solicitor General argued that the actions of Perez constituted treason
because his acts helped the Japanese to “maintain and preserve the
morale of the soldiers.” The majority of Supreme Court judges disagreed.
The reasoning is worth quoting at some length:

The law of treason does not prescribe all kinds of social, business and
political intercourse between the belligerent occupants of the invaded
country and its inhabitants…What aid and comfort constitute[s] treason
must depend upon their nature, degree and purpose…As [a] general rule,
to be treasonous the extent of the aid and comfort given to the enemies
must be to render assistance to them as enemies and not merely as
individuals and in addition, be directly in furtherance of the enemies'
hostile designs…His “commandeering” of women to satisfy the lust of
Japanese officers or men or to enliven the entertainment held in their
honor was not treason even though the women and the entertainment helped
to make life more pleasant for the enemies and boost their spirit; he
was not guilty any more than the women themselves would have been if
they voluntarily and willingly had surrendered their bodies or organized
the entertainment. Sexual and social relations with the Japanese did not
directly and materially tend to improve their war efforts or to weaken
the power of the United State[s]. The acts herein charged were not, by
fair implication, calculated to strengthen the Japanese Empire or its
army or to cripple the defense and resistance of the other side.
Whatever favorable effect the defendant's collaboration with the
Japanese might have in their prosecution of the war was trivial,
imperceptible, and unintentional. Intent of disloyalty is a vital
ingredient in the crime of treason…[^^[578]^^](#_ftn578)

 The argument employed by the court could also, of course, protect those
women who had been accused of treason for their relationships with the
Japanese, whether they were intimate or not; whether they were willing
or involved varying degrees of coercion. However, Perez, who freely
admitted accusations that he had violently coerced women, deceived them,
and knowingly participated in the procurement of sexual slaves for
Japanese officers, would not receive any punishment for those acts,
which were dismissed as “trivial, imperceptible and unintentional” in
their effect. The judges never fully confronted the fact that Perez was
not simply procuring reluctant dance partners for the Japanese but
knowingly facilitating their rape by the officers that they were either
directly submitted to or who were in attendance at the banquets at
which, as testified to in count after count, women were raped. The death
sentence and treason convictions were overturned, to be replaced only
with a conviction on four counts of rape and a 10-17 year sentence for
those encounters in which Perez directly attacked the women himself.

Associate Justice Guillermo Pablo (served 1945-1955), who had served as
a judge in Cebu before the war, and was one of the few Supreme Court
judges at the time who had not served in it during the occupation,
offered a lone dissenting opinion in the case.[^^[579]^^](#_ftn579) He
quoted from the Solicitor General's brief a rather uncomfortable
comparison between the the role of the United Services Organization
(U.S.O.) in providing entertainment for the U.S. army in the Philippines
and the “entertainment” provided for the Japanese Imperial forces. It
appeared incomprehensible to him how the provision of women for the
enemy could not be seen as an example of aid and comfort in wartime, and
therefore treasonous. Pablo, however, did not dance around the issue of
the rape of the women who testified and speak only in more vague terms
of “entertainment.” Instead, the violation of Philippine women was seen
by Pablo as very much a “crime political in nature.” However by
conceding its political nature Pablo shifted the focus from the women
who were the victims of the violence in order to argue that the crimes
of rape and sexual slavery were an affront to the nation itself. He
asked rhetorically whether there could be any greater treason than such
acts. “They took over all of our resource production: everything in
their path, but, by God, save the honor of our
women.”[^^[580]^^](#_ftn580)

The fact that these sexual crimes of war were treated differently in the
treason trials than the other crimes is a reminder that, not only that
in the Philippines, but legal systems around the world had yet to
grapple fully with the relationship between these acts and the
environment of war. In the early postwar trials, the comfort system of
sexual enslavement that involved thousands of women throughout Japanese
occupied areas only received the dedicated attention of a court in the
1948 Batavia Military Tribunal trying Japanese for the rape and forced
prostitution of one particular group of Dutch
women.[^^[581]^^](#_ftn581) Forced prostitution was a prosecutable crime
along with rape and did find mention in trials records elsewhere, if
buried in testimony that covered a wide range of atrocities such as
descriptions of the abduction of women into sexual slavery for German
officers in Smolensk and in the nearby village of
Bassmanova.[^^[582]^^](#_ftn582) Mention of the high incidence of rape
also appeared in the testimony of the war crimes trials in Tokyo and
elsewhere, especially in relation to the atrocities in Nanjing after its
capture in December, 1937.[^^[583]^^](#_ftn583) However, overall after
World War II sexual assaults were given far less direct attention in
terms of actual prosecutions. This is even reflected in compiling of the
records of the Nuremberg trials, as Kelly Dawn Askin has noted: the 42
volumes of transcripts for the trials have no entry in the index for
“rape,” “prostitution,” or even “women” while having over three pages
for “looting.”[^^[584]^^](#_ftn584)

 The Philippine Supreme Court was, as in all treason cases, not
evaluating the issue in terms of the international laws of war but in a
domestic legal context in which the choice was between the common crime
of rape and the capital crime of treason. Rejecting the “political”
nature of the crimes did not remove the possibility of punishment but it
was a telling exception given its other rulings. As the dissenting
opinion of Justice Pablo suggests, it is not at all clear that
“nationalizing” the crime of rape by including it as a form of treason,
and thus bringing it into line with other forms of violence thus branded
by the courts, could have brought Philippine society any closer to
confronting the issues of rape and sexual enslavement as weapons of war
and expressions of occupation power, or, more importantly, addressed the
needs of survivors of the violence themselves. It would not be until the
wars of Yugoslavia in the 1990s that the full range of these issues
would begin to receive considerable attention in the academic, legal,
and social realms.[^^[585]^^](#_ftn585)

*The 1953 Pardons*

The treason trials in the Philippines were carried out alongside the war
crimes trials for Japanese occupation forces in the Philippines. From
1945 to 1947 American military courts tried war criminals who were
charged with conventional crimes of war (category B) and of the new
crimes against humanity (category C), including the famous trials of
generals Yamashita Tomoyuki and Homma Masaharu. Numbering almost a
hundred trials and continuing after Philippine independence in 1946,
they resulted in a 90% conviction rate and 69
executions.[^^[586]^^](#_ftn586) Although President Osmeña had created a
National War Crimes Office in August, 1945 in order to collect evidence
about atrocities in the Philippines, an agreement on transfer of the
responsibility to the Philippine courts was not reached until the spring
of 1947.[^^[587]^^](#_ftn587) The People’s Court was already a
significant burden on the Philippine national budget and President Roxas
successfully pleaded for American legal and logistical assistance to
continue carrying on the trials in its own courts.[^^[588]^^](#_ftn588)
These Philippine run war crimes trials began in August, 1947 and
continued until December, 1949, convicting 138 Japanese soldiers and
civilians out of 155 total arraigned in the trials, and sentencing some
79 of them to death.[^^[589]^^](#_ftn589) Three executions were carried
out in 1948 and over two years later, in January, 1951, another 14 were
suddenly put to death. In the months that followed, sympathy for the
plight of those imprisoned grew rapidly among the Japanese public, and
Japanese, American, and even Chinese diplomatic representatives placed
direct and indirect pressure on the Philippine government to put an end
to the executions and consider a return of the remaining prisoners to
Japan.[^^[590]^^](#_ftn590) Domestically, leading occupation period
officials such as former Makapili vice-Supremo Pio Duran and Senator
Camilo Osias who had both themselves benefited from an amnesty, were
active in supporting moves to release the Japanese war
criminals.[^^[591]^^](#_ftn591) Massive petition drives within Japan
eventually totaling millions of signatures showed the breadth of
mobilization efforts behind the issue, but there were concerns within
the Philippines that Japanese war reparations to the Philippines would
become tied to fate of the war criminals.[^^[592]^^](#_ftn592)

On June 27, 1953 President Quirino announced that many Japanese war
criminals would be among those included in the annual presidential
pardons.[^^[593]^^](#_ftn593) All except those Japanese given a death
sentence were to be pardoned. Japanese war criminals who were awaiting
execution were given life sentences instead, but these were to be served
in Japan rather than the Philippines.[^^[594]^^](#_ftn594) Quirino chose
to give a series of pardons instead of offering an amnesty, thus
avoiding the need for a congressional concurrence resolution that, as we
saw, had resulted in such heated debates and divisions over the 1948
amnesty for political collaborators. The pardons took effect July 4 and
the decree would eventually lead to the return to Japan of 106 war
criminals, most of them by boat later that month. However, while the
pardons of the Japanese had the most significant international impact,
they did not compose the largest number of individuals on the list of
these 1953 pardons. Hundreds of Filipinos convicted of treason would
also go free.

On July 4, 1953, 323 names of convicted traitors who were to be released
that day were published.[^^[595]^^](#_ftn595) Among these 323 can be
found 122 names that match those in the 157 Supreme Court rulings on
treason cases listed in Appendix B. The 35 names in Supreme Court
rulings not found on the pardon list include 20 individuals whose cases
were overturned by the Supreme Court that we would not, in any case,
expect to be in prison, one death sentence that may have carried out,
and five persons whose sentences were shorter than *reclusion perpetua*
that may have paroled early. This leaves only nine other individuals not
on the pardon list for unknown reasons. They may have died in prison,
been released early, or not have qualified for the amnesty, but they do
not represent, for example, cases tied to the worst massacres. Among
those that did make it onto the pardon list was one of the two whose
death sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court, Roman Vilo, and also
Susano Perez, whose treason conviction was overturned but replaced with
several counts of rape. The total number of 323 pardons includes some
201 names not found in the 157 Supreme Court rulings which exceed the
number of People’s Court convictions reached by the time of the 1948
amnesty. If these others were also convicted of treason, or crimes that
replaced them such as in the case of Susano Perez, it is a strong
indication that the courts of first instance proceeded with convictions
in the years that followed on an even larger scale than that of the
People’s Court.[^^[596]^^](#_ftn596)

The day the collaborators were released the American communist and a
leading Huk fighter who had been captured in the year before, William
Pomeroy, watched them make their way to freedom from the National
Penitentiary in Muntinglupa prison.[^^[597]^^](#_ftn597)

As prisoners, the collaborators have been tolerated, their identities
blurred in the orange mass of the prison population, but on the day the
released group marches to the control gate, carrying their rolled-up
possessions, the memory of their wartime behavior surges back. From the
upper windows of buildings, water and missiles are poured down upon the
collaborators. Prisoners strain at the bars, screaming, "Taksil!
Taksil!" (Traitor! Traitor!). There is more respect for the thief and
murderer here than for the traitor.[^^[598]^^](#_ftn598)

The timing and reasoning behind the mass pardon remain to be explained.
Did it serve to balance out the pardon of so many Japanese war
criminals? Was it a calculated move by an embattled President Quirino in
an election year to gain votes? Though he won the primary to become the
Liberal party’s presidential candidate only a month before the pardons,
mid-1953 found a sick and bed-ridden Quirino in desperate straights as
his political strength also drained under claims of corruption,
authoritarian abuses and the increasingly obvious fact that the
Americans would firmly back his opponents. In May, Claro Recto, his most
eloquent if not his most powerful rival,[^^[599]^^](#_ftn599) was
briefly arrested on trumped up bigamy charges, and the political theater
descended further into farce when the President claimed in an interview
on 1 June that he had evidence from captured Huks showing that Jose P.
Laurel, Claro Recto and other political rivals were secretly in league
with the very rebels who, under the Japanese occupation, would have been
first in line to assassinate them as collaborators.[^^[600]^^](#_ftn600)
Meanwhile, the U.S. government had already shown its hand by shielding
his popular Secretary of National Defense and emerging competing
candidate, Ramon Magsaysay from dismissal the year before when it
invited him to Washington. Magsaysay would gain the support of both
Laurel and Recto to win a crushing victory over Quirino and his running
mate, the occupation period Supreme Court justice Jose Yulo, in a
November, 1953 election that saw his populist approach transform the
machine politics of the Philippines.[^^[601]^^](#_ftn601)

From his view in prison, Pomeroy took a cynical explanation for the
pardons to its limit, suggesting that the release of the Japanese war
criminals was itself the first step, “to enable Quirino to extend an
amnesty to the large group of Filipino collaborators also imprisoned
here, for treason and unspeakable abuses against their own people during
World War II. Quirino hopes this will gain him votes from the families
and townsfolk of the collaborators.”[^^[602]^^](#_ftn602) This is
unlikely. The transfer or release of the Japanese prisoners was the
result of long and delicate negotiations and considerable Japanese
pressure. If the release of the collaborators was Quirino’s primary
concern, then it was a most elaborately concealed move. However, the
idea of linking of pardons of collaborators to political calculation was
not limited to communist commentators. Even if it is possible that
Quirino really did release the Japanese prisoners because, as he claimed
in an interview while undergoing medical treatment in the United States,
“I do not want my children and my people to inherit from me hate for
people who might yet be our friends…” the fact was that those potential
friends, the Japanese people, were also a source of war reparations and
future economic cooperation that may have played a significant role in
the pardons.[^^[603]^^](#_ftn603) The 1948 amnesty debate also offered
ample examples of legislators openly debating the political expediencies
of releasing collaborators. The congressman Manuel T. Cases, who had
predicted that the first amnesty of political collaborators would be
followed “within a few days, or a few weeks” by a second amnesty for the
*poorarians,*a patronizing term for the poor or misguided who made up
the majority of military collaborators, warned the President of the
consequences if he did not do so.

And if the president will not grant an amnesty to the poorarian group, I
tell you, I assure you, that the president will be disappointed in the
next election. The poorarians will not vote for the president if he
forgets them.... He knows that if he does not extend this amnesty there
are two groups of voters that will vote against him in the next
election. The first group is composed of the voters who are the friends
and relatives of those people to whom amnesty is not extended. The
second group will be a group of voters who are related to the people who
were once helped by these persons to whom amnesty will not be
granted...[^^[604]^^](#_ftn604)

It was the then congressman Ramon Magsaysay himself, however, who
dismissed as trivial the political cost of denying them amnesty in a
response to congressman Cases. After all, “what percentage of votes
would the *poorarian* spies or collaborators represent,” he asked
disparagingly. Not enough, apparently, to defeat his own presidential
candidacy in the 1953 election. However, if a political motive for the
release could be established, it would at the very least suggest a
calculation that the positive response of the two groups Cases refers
to, or at the very least the general goodwill generated from a spirit of
mercy, exceeded any estimated negative fallout from former victims,
their relatives, and more generally those who still shared the rage
shown by the prisoners who watched their fellow inmates walk out the
gate.

The pardon of the collaborators or the war criminals does appear to have
had little immediate impact on the election. An American cable referring
to the announcement noted that the “Manila press carried story without
prominence, made no editorial comment.”[^^[605]^^](#_ftn605) From a
broader historical perspective, biographies of Quirino rarely mention
the pardon of the Japanese war criminals, let alone that of the
collaborators.[^^[606]^^](#_ftn606) The issue of the more general abuse
of the right of presidential pardons did, however, make a brief
appearance in the last weeks of the election campaign and again in the
spring of 1954 once Quirino was out of office. Accusations were made
that many pardons were politically motivated and that Quirino made use
of pardoned prisoners to “terrorize voters.” This resulted in the
resignation of Justice Luis P. Torres from the Board of Parole and
Pardons, who insisted that his office had no connection to the pardons
issued by presidential decree.[^^[607]^^](#_ftn607)

The President’s brother and political troubleshooter Antonio Quirino
came to his defense on the matter. Antonio was a remarkable figure in
his own right. As a former People’s Court judge he once rejected the
“shield” defense used by wartime collaborators in treason trials who
claimed they were merely working to protect the people from greater
hardship at the hands of the Japanese saying, “‘for the good of the
people’ means and should mean the ultimate good; not merely the
temporary relief from want and harm.”[^^[608]^^](#_ftn608) He then went
on to resign his position in order to serve as defense attorney in the
treason case of none other than the most distinguished proponent of the
“shield” defense, the leader of the wartime republic Jose P.
Laurel.[^^[609]^^](#_ftn609) During the 1953 election, Antonio rejected
the criticism surrounding the “rampant” use of pardons by his brother on
a radio show “Meet the Press,” saying that nobody had the right to
question the president’s constitutionally protected right to grant
pardons to whomever he chose.[^^[610]^^](#_ftn610)

 After the election a Senate “blue ribbon” investigative committee again
took up the issue of Quirino’s excessive use of pardons during his
presidency. The committee claimed that two thirds of the approximately
1,200 pardons issued by the president had been made without consultation
or the recommendation of the Board of Pardons and Parole, thus
exonerating Justice Torres. It claimed that 200 of the pardons were made
on behalf of Liberal Party leaders and also criticized the pardon of the
collaborators and Japanese war criminals which had been carried out
without sufficiently investigating their cases. The result of this
investigation was not, however, any legal action against the former
president, but a merely a series of proposals to set reasonable limits
on the presidential pardon system itself.[^^[611]^^](#_ftn611)

*The Consequences*

As was the case in many parts of the former Japanese Empire, these
efforts at retribution were carried out in an environment of significant
political instability. We have already seen how the precarious state of
British control in Burma determined the outcome the debates over holding
controversial trials there. In India, while the worst of the violence
was yet to come, British colonial officials already feared the worst as
they weighed their options. Just as this environment created abundant
political opportunities for individuals and organizations who regarded
themselves free of wartime sins, it constrained the available choices
for postwar regimes even in those cases where there was some political
will to respond to widespread calls for retribution. Unsurprisingly, the
choices made in the retribution process came with consequences.

For historians of the Philippines, the legacy of the Japanese occupation
and of the 1948 is the historical continuity it represented; it
guaranteed the preservation of an entire strata of prewar elites who had
survived the war, though we might note this was an outcome anything but
unique to the former American colony.[^^[612]^^](#_ftn612) Whether the
accused political and economic collaborators believed, deep in their
heart, in the Japanese cause of an Asia for Asians and its fight against
imperialism, or not; whether that belief, if sincere, was a betrayal of
the nation or the sign of a true patriot; whether they bought and sold
goods with the occupiers to vastly expand their wealth or merely to
subsist in hard times; whether they believed torture and execution
awaited any refusal of Japanese orders or that their cooperation might
lighten the burden upon the people — all of these questions, important
as some of them might be to the moral dilemmas of collaboration, have
little bearing on the fact that large numbers of convictions under a
narrow and unsympathetic interpretation of their acts in wartime would
have resulted in a fundamental political and social reordering of the
Philippines.

 There were, however, other consequences resulting from the choices
made. When the 1948 amnesty argued that “public sentiment did not
extend” to those who waged war on the Philippines and carried out
atrocities against the people, it set aside some acts of violence as
fundamentally different in nature. It did this in a fashion not entirely
dissimilar from the way war crimes trials around the world after World
War II, including the Philippines, similarly struggled to create and
foster a own realm of universally prohibited violence. However, the
trials for treasonous atrocities and war crimes trials differed in two
fundamental ways: in the cases of Burma, India and the Philippines that
we have seen here, the retributive process created this space, or
attempted to create this space, at the conclusion of a process of
elimination rather than an active attempt to confront the horrors of the
war. Secondly, in each case the violence at the heart of the charges
were, as we have seen, ever-clouded by the primary crime they were
judged for: a violation of an allegiance to the nation. When William
Pomeroy noted that the traitors who walked out of prison on that July
day in 1953 were more despised than thieves and murderers, one might
have noted that almost all of those released by President Quirino’s
pardons were convicted of the *treason* *of murder*; each held
responsible for the deaths of their countrymen at their own or Japanese
hands as a result of their collaboration.

Even if the violent crimes in the Philippine trials are considered
without the obscuring veil of the treason charges that encapsulated
them, the rules of the game when it came to command responsibility
differed significantly from the most noteworthy war crimes trial held in
the archipelago: the prosecution of General Yamashita Tomoyuki by a U.S.
military court for the atrocities of his men. The Yamashita case of late
1945, which resulting in his conviction and execution, established a
principle of strict liability in command responsibility for war crimes
that would not be approached again in law until the 1977 Additional
Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions or in actual cases until the
later stages of the war crimes trials in the former
Yugoslavia.[^^[613]^^](#_ftn613) Judges in the Yamashita case held that
he could only have been ignorant of the widespread atrocities committed
by soldiers under his command if this ignorance was a willing
one.[^^[614]^^](#_ftn614) However, the high bar set for treason
convictions in the Philippines virtually guaranteed that any distance
between the violence and the accused would result in a dismissal. In
Burma, Aung San himself carried out one of the executions that fell
within the realm of prohibited violence that the British had come to
adopt in their effort to severely curtail their treason trials in the
colony, thus posing for them a unique challenge. In the Philippines,
however, the “small fry” collaborators who were so patronizingly
referred to as the “ignorant simpleminded credulous Filipino,” by
congressman Lorenzo Sumulong in the 1948 amnesty debates, carried out
their daily interactions with the Japanese occupier within earshot of
the screams of the tortured, and as witnesses or themselves participants
in the executions. When they evaded responsibility by claiming to be,
“just following orders” to cooperate with the Japanese military or to
join in the urgent task of eradicating the “bandits” throughout the land
these excuses were, in the majority of cases, dismissed by the Supreme
Court, as they were in the trials of war criminals. However, the
responsibility for the atrocities that came with military collaboration
rarely extended beyond the immediate scene of the crime.

 This was a matter of course for those “political collaborators” who
were civilian heads of military organizations but who were not close to
their day-to-day operations such as Jose P. Laurel, who organized
wartime “pacification” committees, and Pio Duran who was nominally
vice-supremo of the Makapili. However, it was just as true for actual
military commanders, as we saw in the acquittal of the surviving former
head of the wartime Bureau of Constabulary, Guillermo Francisco. Even
more remarkable, was the inability to account for any kind of command
responsibility in the trial of the head of the wartime Manila police,
Antonio Torres. Francisco might have, albeit feebly, argued that the
national scope of the Constabulary was such that he was completely
ignorant of the fact that many of his units, even those who maintained
strong connections to some resistance forces, were actively engaged in
the suppression of Huks and other guerrillas, regularly engaged in
torture, and that some units carried out summary executions. It is far
harder to imagine that Torres could have been wartime Manila police
chief without being aware of the deep collaboration between his officers
and the Japanese military police, or the torture and execution of
suspects being carried out by the secret service division of the Manila
Police Department that resulted, for example, in the treason conviction
of one of its officers, Pedro Santos Balingit.[^^[615]^^](#_ftn615) As
in the case of Francisco, the case against Torres was dismissed even
before the 1948 amnesty. This exoneration of wartime guilt so emboldened
Torres that he immediately proceeded to petition for the removal of his
replacement, Eduardo Quintos, so that he might be rightfully restored as
chief of police. The mayor of Manila turned down his request in 1948,
but he pressed his case with a letter to President Quirino and then
directly brought a legal case against police chief Quintos. The Supreme
Court itself ruled on the case in April 1951, when the majority opinion
rejected his arguments.[^^[616]^^](#_ftn616)

Even if a principle of command responsibility had been adopted
establishing liability on either a narrow or broad level, the limited
treason trials of military collaborators and perpetrators of atrocities
could not hope to offer anything close to a full reckoning with the
wartime torture, arson, rape and summary executions of the kind
described in the cases that did reach the courts, precisely because
collaborators had no monopoly on these acts. The brutality of some
guerrillas rivaled that of the worst atrocities of the occupying forces
and their domestic allies. Ray Hunt, himself a mid-level guerrilla
leader in Luzon, had great respect for the conduct of some of his fellow
leaders but conceded,

Many a Filipino “guerilla” was concerned mostly to take advantage of
current confusion to avenge himself on old enemies, destroy some rival
family, betray a political foe to the Japanese, or simply to indulge a
taste for sadism. Cruel as the Japanese were to everyone else, cruel as
some despicable Americans were to suspected Filipino collaborators,
nobody exceeded the savageries various depraved Filipinos inflicted on
their own countrymen.[^^[617]^^](#_ftn617)\
 \

Hunt struggled with his own issues of command responsibility. Some
guerrillas under his command captured a spy who, in a public display to
impress some villagers, “was bled to death, and each guerrilla in the
band that had captured him drank his blood. His heart was then torn from
his body and roasted over an open fire, after which each guerrilla ate a
bit of it.” Hunt was disgusted but took no action against them, since
“to have executed the whole guerrilla troop responsible would have
demoralized all my men…”[^^[618]^^](#_ftn618) Though facing an entirely
different scale of violence, similar words could have easily been
uttered by Colonel Nagahama Akira, head of the military police in the
occupied Philippines. During his American military war crimes trial
Nagahama claimed that, despite an attempt to ban torture and enforce a
more humane policy towards prisoners, “the tremendous weight of the
forces which worked against any possible materialization of the good
intentions I possessed,” robbed him of success and “each day that passed
strengthened the hands of those who from the outset could not bring
themselves to follow a course other than outright force and the
imposition of fear.”[^^[619]^^](#_ftn619) The American guerrilla claims
to have provided some minimal judicial proceeding for arrested spies and
collaborators under his direct control, unlike many other guerrilla
groups, but since there were no means to hold them, “the accused was
either found innocent and released or found guilty and
executed.”[^^[620]^^](#_ftn620) Hunt could have probably sympathized
with a young Japanese language teacher Ogawa Tetsuro (小川哲郎),
attached to a Japanese military unit in Luzon, who wrote “Kill or be
killed; that was the way of the battlefield, the way of war. Yet, to
this day I can’t forget the cry of the Filipino, ‘*Hinde ako
masama!’*(I’m not bad).”[^^[621]^^](#_ftn621)

This does not mean that atrocities committed by guerrillas during the
war received no attention at all from the postwar courts. However, long
before President Roxas issued his 1948 amnesty for political and
economic collaborators, he had on September 7, 1946 issued Proclamation
No. 8, “Granting amnesty to all persons who committed acts penalized
under the revised penal code in furtherance of the resistance to the
enemy.”[^^[622]^^](#_ftn622) The guerrilla amnesty made exceptions for
“crimes against chastity” and those carried out “from purely personal
motives.” Until there is a study of the work of the Guerrilla Amnesty
Commissions formed following the amnesty to decide what cases fell under
these exceptions, however, it is hard to determine how seriously these
crimes were taken.[^^[623]^^](#_ftn623) It is interesting to note,
however, that the exception for crimes committed for “purely personal
motives” mirrored the burden borne by prosecutors of treason
convictions. Whereas conviction for treason required proof of adherence
to Japan, any prosecution of guerrilla atrocities, no matter how
horrifying, required positive evidence that the accused was not actually
motivated by the spirit of resistance.

The most terrible massacres found in the treason cases considered here
are from the final chaotic period from the fall of 1944 to the summer of
1945 were a period of desperation for both the retreating Japanese and
their allies. It peaked following the American landings and the vast
increase in guerrilla attacks that followed. It was in these months that
vengeance and all manner of score settling—in the name of the
resistance—rose to the level of a mass hunt. In the amnesty debate of
1948 congressman Leon Cabarroguis deplored the fact that a high wartime
official in his own Luzon province of Nueva Vizcaya would go free while
the 300 spies and “magic eyes” who he claimed served him would remain in
prison. Congressman Alejo Santos seemed unconcerned, “Most of them were
killed on the road to Kiangan; when the guerrillas captured them, they
were given speedy justice.”[^^[624]^^](#_ftn624) One witness in Batangas
province, south of Manila, described how everyone beat and kicked
tied-up “Makapilis” captured in his area, before they were driven away
by the hundreds. The fate of others was less ambiguous, “I saw at least
50 of them, also tied together, brought out to the sea on bancas. They
never came back.”[^^[625]^^](#_ftn625) In newly captured Cebu, which
perhaps not coincidentally is overrepresented in the post-amnesty
treason trials, many collaborators turned themselves in directly to the
American Counter-Intelligence Corps in order to avoid the “speedy
justice” that awaited them at the hands of guerrilla liquidation units
sometimes called “trigger squads. ”[^^[626]^^](#_ftn626)

These darker memories of guerrilla justice were not suppressed and
commonly found expression in postwar films. In the “American Guerrilla
in the Philippines” (1950) a scene is dedicated to the confrontation
between a village and a fleeing informer. While the village looked on
quietly, the informer was offered a piece of chicken as his last meal.
Before he was shot, he was simply told, “You are a fifth columnist and a
bad man and we are going to kill you.” In “Lost Battalion” (1962) the
main antagonists are not the Japanese, but a cruel band of rival
guerrillas led by the smooth talking villain Bruno. In “Back Door to
Hell” (1964), two American officers try to save Japanese prisoners of
war from torture at the hand of Filipino guerrillas but during
interrogation the officer, played by a young Jack Nicholson, apparently
failed to sufficiently impress them with his Japanese language
abilities. The guerrillas took over, extracted the required information
by torture and executed the prisoners. These scenes were structured not
to condemn the Filipino guerrillas for their cruelty. They were designed
to highlight the naivety of the newly arrived Americans, and presumably
the audience, who did not understand the realities of war. In “Manila,
Open City” (1968), the audience learns that when it came to the
Makapili, “the guerrillas have been butchering them ever since they
moved into town” and one of the leading Filipino characters in the film,
when exposed as a “Makapili informer” is shot and left to die by the
road. The director offers him a brief hint of sympathy as the audience
watches him die, giving him the lines, “You want to know why? I don’t
know why. I just wanted to get along.” The line was a well chosen
shibboleth used by those accused of wartime collaboration around the
world. Rarely, however, did a film show greater compassion for the fate
of an executed collaborator than the 1976 “Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos”
(Three Godless Years), a film written and directed by Mario O’Hara
produced during the Marcos dictatorship. The story follows a
schoolteacher Rosario (Nora Aunor) through her experiences of rape by,
and later dependence upon a Japanese-Filipino officer during the
occupation. Her tragedy is complete when the war ends and, in a powerful
scene, she is shorn and killed by a vengeful mob.

Americans who arrived on the shores of Leyte in October, 1944 and on
Luzon in January, 1945 stepped, therefore, into a world without mercy.
William A. Owens, an American Counter-Intelligence Corps agent had as
one of his central tasks the investigation of cases of collaboration
with the Japanese and his records, along with those of other agents,
would form the foundation of evidence in all later treason trials.
However, when he arrived in central Luzon where USAFFE guerrillas, which
included Hunt’s forces, were engaged in a full scale civil war against
the Huk guerrillas, he was ordered to, “restore law and order.” To him,
the details of his mission, “sounded very much like a Japanese peace and
pacification campaign.”[^^[627]^^](#_ftn627) His account of the spring
of 1945, while the Japanese were still fighting a retreat in the north
of the island, is more than anything a candid account of his horror at
the violence around him as he records the morbid digging up of the
corpse of a local Mayor who had been “foxholed” (buried alive) by Huks
that were merely carrying out their standard wartime punishment for
uncooperative officials branded collaborators, and his gradual
realization that the USAFFE guerrillas who opposed them could be equally
brutal, torturing and executing any suspected Huks.[^^[628]^^](#_ftn628)
When Owens confronted a USAFFE officer about a standing order to “shoot
Huks on sight,” the commander, “was courteous to me but firm in his
conviction that shooting Huks was the only way to stop
them.”[^^[629]^^](#_ftn629)

The continuation of civil violence into the aftermath of the Japanese
occupation, the devastation of the economy by the war, and a rapid, if
temporary move by the United States to limit its interventions in
Philippine affairs in the immediate aftermath of independence in 1946
ensured that, even if there had been widespread willingness to confront
the atrocities of war committed by its own people in more general terms,
such an effort would have faced insurmountable financial and political
obstacles; a fact not at all untypical for post-conflict societies down
to the present day. A January 1946 report submitted to U.S. Attorney
General by Walter R. Hutchinson lamented the fact that, “instead of
disposing of the cases in the same manner as the other United Nations,
we gave the basic and gigantic problem of collaborationism to the
Commonwealth government…”[^^[630]^^](#_ftn630) However, had the outgoing
colonial power set out to try any collaborators themselves on the very
eve of Philippine independence, it is hard to imagine things going
better for the United States than they did in India for the British.
This is especially true for all cases of treason, but it is unlikely to
have fared better if they limited cases to those involving atrocities
and omitted the charge of betrayal. Today there continues to be broad
reluctance in most civil war-torn societies for international
*assistance*, let alone the *supervision* of retributive or
reconciliatory processes not only because of a distrust in international
institutions to fairly judge violations of universal rights, but a
fundamental feeling of a monopoly over the right of the *nation* which
claims the suffering to decide the forms and outcomes of transitional
justice—whether or not the victims and survivors constituted a
representative part of that imagined community.

If this is still true in our own age, then it was all the more the case
in the aftermath of World War II, when new innovations in international
law, including the development of the concepts of crimes against peace
and humanity, had enough difficulty in establishing a footing without
having to confront the fundamental hybridity of the conflicts they
addressed: relatively long military occupations in which some of the
most brutal crimes of war happened far from the battlefront but, more
importantly, were carried out by a thoroughly mixed dramatis personæ
that included both foreign and domestic perpetrators. The explosion of
extrajudicial killings and other forms of retribution in the period of
transition was the most tragic but predictable outcome. In many
liberated territories of the late 1940s, however, the only real chance
for survivors of the atrocities of war carried out by domestic
perpetrators to find redress through a judicial process, whatever its
weaknesses, was through charges of treason. As we have seen in India,
Burma, and the Philippines, not only did the transformation of treason
trials into, essentially, trials for crimes of war, emerge only
haphazardly in these cases thanks to the rapidly shrinking support for a
wide sweeping purge of collaborators of all colors, but they were marred
by the fact they were targeting “*turncoats* who happened to be
*brutes*” while leaving it abundantly clear to everyone that the attempt
to confront the wartime legacies of the latter would only be attempted
through a process of purging the former.

*The Aftermath*

In the Philippines, the inability of any of the postwar and post-amnesty
treason trials, to come close to the creation of a more general realm of
prohibited violence is clear from the continuities of violence in the
postwar period. The Philippine Constabulary, already practiced in the
art of crushing agrarian dissent before the war, continued to gain
experience working side-by-side with the Japanese soldiers who were
fresh from the mopping up campaigns they had carried out throughout
China. Torture and summary executions by their successor, the Military
Police Command (in 1948 renamed again the Philippine Constabulary before
being fully merged into the Armed forces in 1950), especially in their
campaigns against the Huks, continued into the postwar period, peaking
during the “Iron Fist” suppression campaign from
1946-1949.[^^[631]^^](#_ftn631) The most infamous perpetrators of
violence in this period were the Nenita “skull squadron” led by the
Napoleon Valeriano and other similar “hunter-killer”
units.[^^[632]^^](#_ftn632) The sheer scale of atrocities appears to
have declined overall in the early 1950s with the rise of new
counter-insurgency approaches under the leadership of Defense secretary
Magsaysay, despite the suspension of habeas corpus by President Quirino
in October, 1950.[^^[633]^^](#_ftn633) Meanwhile, the “trigger squads”
of the Hukbalahap and their postwar successors continued their wartime
practice of capturing, sometimes torturing, and finally shooting or
burying alive “traitors” in areas of their control. As their
circumstances worsened and the rebellion weakened, their liquidation of
suspected spies and informants increased, not only further alienating
them from the masses they claimed to represent, but cannibalizing their
own ranks as a result of internal purges. By 1951, some of its squadrons
were carrying out orders to liquidate Filipinos who defied a Huk boycott
and voted the midterm elections, while others were asked to liquidate
family members who had begged them to surrender. The longtime former
military commander of the Huks turned apostate Luis Taruc noted in his
prison memoir, “One cannot tell the story of the Huk rebellion without
remembering that the ruthlessness of its opponents diminished with the
years; the government came to conduct the fight more intelligently as
time went on. But the reverse was true of the Communist-led
Huks.”[^^[634]^^](#_ftn634)

Nothing better symbolizes the continuity of occupation period horrors
into the postwar, however, than the survival, especially before 1950 but
sporadically in counter-insurgency campaigns in decades since, of the
practice of*zona*. In June, 1961 a seminar on the lessons to be learned
from the Huk suppression campaign was held at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.
Following a lecture on military operations by “skull squadron” commander
Napoleon Valeriano, Major Medardo T. Justiniano took the podium and, in
his talk on combat intelligence, introduced his audience to the use of
the “magic eye” against the Huks.

…[It] is extremely difficult for an intelligence officer to identify
which man is an enemy and which one is not. That constant problem we
often solved by the use of surrenderees, and in which we found the Magic
Eye technique effective. This Magic Eye system allowed us to take
advantage of the psychological opportunities and at the same time
protect the life of the families of the surrenderee.

Take for instance a situation wherein we rounded up all the civilians of
a town. We would construct a special tent for the prisoner, with a
peephole. He would be concealed while the civilians were made to pass
before this “Magic Eye,” hidden in a tent. Naturally all these people
would start feeling a sense of fright because they might be identified.
This type of operation helped us a lot tactically and
psychologically.[^^[635]^^](#_ftn635)\
 \

Colonel Valeriano and Major Charles Bohannan, a U.S. advisor in the
campaign who gave his own lecture after Justiniano, may have shifted
uncomfortably in their seats at this enthusiastic description of the
Magic Eye. In a book published by the two the following year, they were
far more critical of the use of zoning as the “standard technique for
obtaining information from a presumably hostile village” from 1946-1950.
Though they claimed Constabulary forces did not “resort to Japanese
brutalities” when carrying it out, they recognized that, “After the
Japanese occupation, zona connoted unlicensed brutality, which Huk
propaganda exploited.” Describing in great detail the logistics of one
“well-planned” zoning operation in which adult villagers passed “under
the scrutiny of the hooded ‘magic eye’ informants,” the authors noted
that, “a villager will scarcely react sympathetically to government
forces after such an action.”[^^[636]^^](#_ftn636) When he became
Secretary of National Defense, Ramon Magsaysay, whose wartime guerrilla
forces would have themselves been targeted by zoning operations during
the occupation, limited their use, “which had been one of the greatest
sources of bitterness and complaints against the Armed
Forces.”[^^[637]^^](#_ftn637)

**Part III: Winning Over Puppets and Reforming Traitors**

\

\

In the previous chapters we have seen how several efforts at carrying
out limited retribution against military and police collaborators were
gradually replaced by efforts to punish only those responsible for
atrocities. In most cases, these proceedings were still carried out
under laws against treason and sedition. Military and police
collaboration with the Japanese empire presented postwar regimes with
their most challenging class of traitors. Together with informers, these
figures were more likely than anyone to participate directly or
indirectly in the most violent acts of the occupation. Whether they were
Indian police officers torturing prisoners on behalf of the Japanese
military, Burmese forces taking over villages long under the control of
other ethnic groups, or Philippine Bureau of Constabulary units who
selectively crushed rivals in a divided resistance, these forces could
not be counted upon to, as some postwar apologists might like to
believe, insulate a vulnerable populace from the repression of a foreign
occupier. Not only did some military and police collaborators show a
greater propensity for brutality than the Japanese units they
accompanied—sometimes motivated by personal hatreds or a fear of what
awaited them at the hands of their enemies after Japanese defeat, but
the instability created by a contested military occupation often allowed
parties of both new and old social, political, and ethnic conflicts to
find violent resolution under the protection and legitimacy provided
either by Japanese occupation authorities or those who proclaimed the
cause of resistance against them.

The ranks of Japan’s armed allies, including thousands of occupation
police, militias, auxiliaries, “puppet” soldiers, and colonial levies
represented a cross-section of occupied societies distinctive only for
the heavy representation of the most disadvantaged classes. The Makapili
of the Philippines, recruits for the Burma Independence Army, the
hundreds of thousands of soldiers who fought with Japanese forces in
China, and the Korean colonial police forces may have all have had
leaders from the ranks of the elite, but were mostly made up of farmers,
refugees, or the urban poor. To dismiss every member of a relatively
small and short-lived armed group such as the Makapili as deviants and
thugs was one thing—something made all the more easy by associating them
with the terrifying magic eye informers, but it was more difficult for
postwar regimes, especially in the Philippines, Korea, and China, to
account for the years of involvement by large numbers of ordinary
citizens in occupation institutions of repression. The Philippine Bureau
of Constabulary was not just a good cover for resistance work, it was a
well paid position in a time of wartime hardship. A young Korean with a
limited education who entered the police had better prospects for
advancement than in most alternate careers in a colony filled with
discriminatory barriers. A Chinese village militia that was once
supported by a long-since-fled landlord may have found cooperation with
the local Japanese garrison a far less daunting option than going in
search of embattled Communist guerrillas in the hills.

From the perspective of resistance groups, and in the heroic narratives
they passed on to postwar regimes, these figures earned a place of
infamy in the pantheon of treasonous villains found around the world
after the Second World War, alongside the informer, the interpreter, the
enemy’s mistress, the spineless merchant, and the puppet leader.
However, what distinguished most of the military and police
collaborators from the rest of these hated characters was the anonymity
of their numbers. Unlike the toady interpreter or treacherous informer,
usually portrayed as a hunched and effeminate figure standing behind a
Japanese soldier, or the image of the bejeweled mistress walking proudly
with her officer and patron, the mass of hundreds or thousands of
militia and police were mostly faceless figures, often depicted,
accurately in many cases, as dirty and disheveled in contrast with the
crisp uniform of the occupier. Whatever violent acts they partook in, it
was easier to see these men not as lacking patriotism but merely
misguided souls still unclaimed by the nation.

Far more important than the anonymity of numbers, however, was the
threat those numbers constituted to the survival of any postwar regime.
In most transitional regimes, whether they are emerging from a foreign
occupation, a civil war, or a revolution, a new government must evaluate
at least the four most challenging costs of dismantling or and punitive
action against domestic enemy forces: 1) the lost opportunity or
challenges of employing these forces for their own purposes, 2) the
active force required to carry out disarmament or retribution, 3) the
potential disorder and discord caused should retributive violence get
out of control, and 4) the possible threat of these forces embracing a
political rival rather than risk punishment. The strength of calls to
punish treason and avenge specific atrocities committed by these forces
are factors which can limit the range of viable choices or at the very
least seriously affect the outcome, thus acting as a potential moral and
cultural obstacle to what might otherwise be a raw political or military
calculation.

In early postwar India and Burma, as well as in the case of the Dutch
East Indies, where the Japanese trained PETA was the equivalent of the
Indian National Army and the Burma Independence Army, the victorious
European empires had to contend with thousands of trained soldiers who
were not only sworn enemies but also had an unquenched thirst for
independence. Their professed cause was in no way discredited by Japan’s
surrender. On the contrary, it was, as we have seen in Burma,
emboldened. Demobilizing these forces was a significant challenge; large
scale retribution, all but impossible. Before the end of the decade, all
three colonies had gained independence, but only at the cost of a
violent partition in India, the beginning of a decades long civil war in
Burma, and a hard fought revolutionary war in Indonesia.

In the Philippines, where a scheduled 1944 independence from the United
States was only slightly delayed by the Japanese occupation, the
returning Americans and the new government of the new 1946 republic
faced its most serious armed competitors not among the ranks of the
collaborators, but from the resistance, especially the ideologically
committed Hukbalahap. The Philippines was offered a nominal sovereignty
by Japan at the same time Burma was in 1943, and the Japanese empire
deployed much of the same rhetoric against Western imperialism. However,
the Bureau of Constabulary, though like the INA composed in great part
by POWs and offered “rejuvenation” under Japanese tutelage, never much
resembled either the INA or the BIA and its successors in Burma. The
Philippine BoC neither unified behind charismatic nationalist commanders
nor was it an army that cultivated a strong dedication to the cause of
an elusive independence. Its prewar composition, as well as its wartime
and postwar incarnations all became closely tied to local collaborating
elites or, covertly, with factions within the local resistance that
reflected longer trends in the power dynamics of the community, rather
than with a broader national movement. Alternative forces which may have
borne greater resemblance to Burmese and Indian counterparts, including
the Makapili, were given little opportunity to develop, and were plunged
into the work of violent repression the moment they came into existence.

In the Philippines, postwar treason prosecutions that could well have
placed tens of thousands of constabulary officers on trial for their
wartime actions were largely prevented, as we have seen, by the
establishment of generous “loyalty boards” which allowed constabulary
officers to quickly resume their service after Japanese surrender, and
the 1949 Supreme Court ruling *People vs. Jose de Castro* which made
explicit the fact that, unlike membership in the Makapili, service in
the Bureau of Constabulary was not, by itself, treasonous. The trials
that followed focused upon the atrocities of the occupation, but
continued to prosecute these crimes as treason, with the complications
and biases that we saw at work in the previous chapter.

This examination of the costs, distortions, and abandonment of treason
prosecutions against wartime military and police collaborators, and
their relationship to the trying of atrocities has focused for the most
part on one particular legal approach to what posed both a political and
military challenge to postwar regimes. With the exception of police
dismissals in Malaya, little has been said of the complex administrative
steps taken to exclude wartime collaborators, whether they were
military, police, or held other positions. While not as sensational as
treason prosecutions, this broader and rarely well-documented process
was also important. In India, the British attempted, with only limited
success, to prevent INA soldiers from becoming part of the police or
Indian or Pakistan army after 1947.[^^[638]^^](#_ftn638) In Burma, one
of the most tense and involved conflicts leading up to independence in
1948 was in determining how many former BNA officers could be absorbed
into the British army, and whether to permit many of those among them
were not accepted to constitute a uniformed militia force under Aung
San’s leadership. In the Philippines, not enough is known about the
workings of the loyalty boards or about other leadership changes in the
Constabulary to explore the ways in which administrative methods were
used to reform, or merely transform this institution in the immediate
aftermath of the war.

Trials and dismissals were not the only—and in many contexts not the
primary—means to handle thousands of treasonous military and police.
Another choice was the mass incorporation of these forces into the
institutions of the postwar order. If punitive measures or the
demobilization and dismissal of collaborators involved heavy costs, the
simple mass absorption of the same into the postwar state could be far
more than simply a logistic challenge: it could threaten the legitimacy
of the regime. The absorption of thousands of Burmese National Army
(later Patriotic Burmese Forces PBF) forces into the British army and
the continued service of Philippine Bureau of Constabulary forces that
had passed loyalty boards are two Southeast Asian examples of this
process of incorporation. In Burma, as we saw, this would come at the
cost of increased tensions with those ethnic groups that were most
effected by wartime repression. In the Philippines, opposition forces
and the Huk rebels made ample use of the Constabulary’s wartime conduct
in its attack on the regime. In neither case, however, was there any
significant effort by the postwar military establishment to force its
new members to confront the conduct of military collaborators during the
war.

This dissertation closes with an examination of an elaborate and
creative approach to military collaborators taken by Communist forces in
Shandong province. Embracing the early approach taken by the British
towards INA “patients” or the Japanese to its Philippine prisoners of
war, the Communist Party in Shandong treated military collaborators with
Japan as men malleable enough to be cured of their affliction. While the
wartime years usually figure as a prelude in most of the discussion of
previous chapters, this chapter must reverse that order to spend the
bulk of its time on the war years from 1937 until Japanese defeat.
Whereas earlier chapters portray the gradual formation of a stable
policy, in this chapter we will see a relatively stable approach briefly
disintegrate in the chaos of Japanese surrender, only to reestablish
itself in the civil war that followed.

But what was this affliction? National betrayal or a propensity for
violent repression? Chinese Communist efforts to win over military
collaborators up to Japanese surrender in Shandong used threats of
punishment for both and yet depended upon a willingness to completely
overlook any sin in exchange for a timely surrender. This feat was
accomplished by separating the Party’s handling of military
collaborators from its punishment of other traitors through mass trials.
For military collaborators to overcome their illegitimate or “puppet”
nature, a change of loyalty was all that was required. In the early
postwar, the re-education efforts launched by the Party continued for
those few Japanese-allied “puppet” soldiers who had the misfortunate of
finding themselves to be prisoners of war in the summer and fall of 1945
but these military collaborators were no longer segregated from an
increasingly unruly mass “Oppose Treason” mass campaign of the early
postwar.

\

**Chapter 7: Winning Over the Puppet Armies of Shandong, 1937-1949**

Nowhere in the Japanese Empire was military collaboration more important
and carried out on a larger scale than in occupied China. By 1945, there
were over 900,000 Chinese men under arms garrisoning towns and
strongholds on behalf of the Japanese Expeditionary Army and its Chinese
client regime in occupied Nanjing.[^^[639]^^](#_ftn639) In accounts of
Japan’s conquests on the Chinese mainland from 1931 to 1945, these
Chinese soldiers are remembered for their incompetence, their treason,
and their cruelty.[^^[640]^^](#_ftn640) They not only prolonged the
Japanese occupation, but contributed to its brutality as active
participants in mop-up campaigns throughout the countryside. While
Japanese training and discipline may have attempted to curb some of the
excesses of their new recruits, their propensity for violence was not
one of them.

For the Chinese Communist Party, these military collaborators played an
important role in the Party’s postwar political struggle. They served as
the most direct link between the repression of the Japanese invaders,
and that of a returning Nationalist government which integrated the
Chinese collaborationist armies into its own forces. By absorbing large
numbers of these tainted and despised armies, Chiang Kai-shek’s
Nationalist government inherited a stain of treason, widely invoked in
variations of the phrase, “the Chiang conspiracy to merge with the enemy
and puppets” (蔣敵偽合流的陰謀).[^^[641]^^](#_ftn641) In Communist
propaganda, the Nationalist government was to be remembered not for
leading the national resistance, but for colluding with the enemy and
reabsorbing its despised henchmen.

This chapter does not fundamentally challenge this portrayal of the
Nationalists. No shortage of Chinese war criminals and other unsavory
officers made their way from allegiance to Japan to fight for the
Nationalists in the civil war of 1945-1949. Indeed, many of the “puppet”
solders began their careers in units at least nominally loyal to the
Nationalist government. Returning to the Nationalist fold after the war,
former “puppets” found good company and familiar assignments among the
executioners of Nationalist pacification teams. Deployed once more into
the field, they were asked to exterminate the real traitors: Communist
bandits (共匪).

Rather than the Nationalists and their treasonous inheritance, the focus
here will be on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wartime and early
postwar response to military collaboration with Japan both as seen in
its central party directives, and as carried out more locally in the
Shandong Base Area. The CCP and its resistance forces in Shandong
province understood the vital role played by military collaborators in
preserving Japanese control over occupied areas, especially after 1942.
They also understood how valuable these armed groups could be as sources
of information, supplies, and in the end, of fighting men. As the
chapter will show, the Party placed tremendous emphasis on “winning
over” (爭取) or else “disintegrating” (瓦解) Chinese units under
Japanese command and worked hard to separate out the category of
military collaborators from other traitors. Historians, including the
producers of the accepted narrative put forth by the CCP itself, often
emphasize the greater success–or treachery–of by the Nationalist party
in absorbing these Chinese forces in the immediate aftermath of Japanese
surrender. However, this often ignores the considerable numbers of
military collaborators who covertly cooperated with or defected to
Communist control.

That some of these commanders were responsible for horrendous violence
against civilians was no insurmountable obstacle to their redeployment,
even when the Party had helped mobilize rallies condemning these same
men for their brutality. Instead of being targeted by the local teams of
the “Traitor Elimination Bureau,” (鋤奸部) which dealt with informers,
spies, trotskyites, and collaborationist officials, up until Japanese
surrender military collaborators with Japan were wooed by agents of the
“Enemy and Puppet Work Bureau” (敵偽工部) who offered very generous
terms for those who defected in time. After being “won over,”
collaborationist units were in many cases not dissolved or disarmed, nor
was it official policy to do so. Following a common practice in Chinese
military campaigns well into the 20^th^ century, these units were simply
renamed and their commanders often allowed to remain in control.

In Communist controlled areas of Shandong, addressing the role of either
treason or atrocities within a process of retribution for military
collaborators was in large part postponed until the end of the conflict
with Japan, even if accusations of national betrayal and brutality
played a leading role in wartime propaganda against them. While
expedience in dealing with military collaborators was fairly universal
in World War II, as in other wars, this was facilitated in this
particular case by a wartime institutional division of labor that served
to isolate most military collaborators from the more unpredictable
outcomes of a “traitor elimination” process which was given an ever
increasing “mass character” (群眾性). Some military collaborators did
face assassination, but these were at the hands of the special armed
operatives of the Enemy and Puppet Bureau who served distinctly tactical
and military rather than political goals, let alone a mandate to carry
out retributive justice.

At the end of the war, this division broke down for a time. Those
military and police collaborators who failed to change sides in time and
found themselves in the custody of Communist allied forces in Shandong
in the weeks before and after surrender were turned over to cadres of
the Public Security Bureau and its traitor elimination work. If, up to
this point, defection might allow them to escape punishment as traitors
or face close scrutiny for wartime violence, they were now potentially
liable for a number of crimes, including that of being traitors, war
criminals, or more vaguely, “bad elements” (壞份子). Together with other
collaborators, many were forced to undergo “training” together and to
make public, sometimes collective, expressions of remorse. They were to
benefit from an official policy of magnanimity and only a small minority
of them subjected to a process of mass trials for collaborators that
were taking place at the same time. Sometimes, as we shall see, calls
for vengeance by the communities who suffered at their hands during the
occupation made a policy of leniency a challenge for the party. Those
who survived the process, or by defection avoided the first round of
retribution would remain easy targets for every wave of revolutionary
violence in the movements to come.

*Military Collaboration in Shandong*

After the establishment of a new Nationalist Government of the Republic
of China in 1940 under Wang Jingwei, a growing mix of Chinese soldiers,
bandits, and militias fighting with the Japanese military were claimed
to constitute a national army for the new regime. In reality, these
units bore dozens of different titles and served hundreds of largely
independent commanders. Though some were directly recruited and
eventually commanded by graduates of military academies established
during the occupation, the majority were not created under Japanese
military or Nanjing sponsorship. These forces were often units that had
been encircled, captured, or that had defected to the Japanese, often
abandoning a proclaimed loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist army.
The Japanese military referred to these as the “surrendered units”
(歸順部隊). To the resisting Nationalists and the Communists, all of the
Chinese armies under Japanese command were collectively known as the
“puppet armies” (偽軍).[^^[642]^^](#_ftn642)

I will continue to employ the widely used term puppet armies here,
without scare quotes, despite its derogatory and political nature. The
term does accurately reflect the degree to which these diverse forces
were dependent upon Japanese tolerance, supplies, and occasional
financial sponsorship to survive. The term falls somewhat short,
however, in accounting for their changeable loyalties. They did not
blindly serve any master but actively sought to retain or expand their
power within the limiting parameters of a tactical alliance with the
Imperial Japanese Army. When this proved stifling or dangerous, they
were often content to switch sides whenever the opportunity presented
itself. As Liu Hsi-ming has argued in a detailed study of the puppet
armies, these soldiers were “pawns vacillating among hegemonic powers,”
who chose their own preservation over the presiding ideological or
nationalist causes of the day.[^^[643]^^](#_ftn643)

The regional character of these forces is important. The puppet armies
were closely tied to, and operated for the most part within, narrow
local boundaries. Units that operated in the Yangzi valley in relative
proximity to the Nanjing capital may have conducted themselves as parts
of a national army under the Wang Jingwei regime. In northern China, the
multiple layers of political and military power that emerged out of
years of Japanese encroachment made for an especially complex
environment. Japanese military influence stretched back to the
Manchurian incident of 1931, and well beyond that to the years of
Japanese presence along the South Manchurian Railroad. In addition to
its sponsorship of a new Manchurian nation in the northeast, in the
early 1930s the Japanese military cultivated a number of local
autonomous political bodies to fragment Nationalist control including
the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and the East Hebei Autonomous
Council. The Japanese military and its intelligence operatives also
developed relationships with local military commanders and
semi-independent warlords, including the powerful Yan Xishan of Shanxi.

These efforts were not always unified in purpose or in approach.
Japanese policies in northern China reflected the competing visions of
the occupation of the various Japanese forces taking part. This was
especially true after 1937 when the conflict expanded. The Manchuria
based Kwantung army, the North China Army and the Central China Army all
jockeyed for influence in planning.[^^[644]^^](#_ftn644) Until the
defection of Wang Jingwei provided the Japanese with a compliant
Nationalist party leader of unquestioned stature, a collaborationist
government in the north under Wang Kemin, supported by the North China
Army, competed for legitimacy with that of a regime in the south with
sponsorship of the Central China Army.[^^[645]^^](#_ftn645) These
appointments and changes had only limited bearing on the ground however.
Under occupation, provincial governments operated more or less
autonomously under officials either reconfirmed in their pre-war
positions or appointed with the blessing of the Japanese military.
Similarly, at the level of local districts throughout North China, local
collaborators approved for membership on Committees of Public Safety
operated in coordination with local Japanese units.[^^[646]^^](#_ftn646)

The Japanese military was reluctant at first to allow its collaborators
to raise an armed force beyond a few local police and personal
bodyguards. Part of this fear grew out of the revolt of forces belonging
to the ostensibly pro-Japanese East Hebei Army in Tongzhou in late July,
1937. Official support for the creation of a national Chinese army that
was capable of working with the Japanese military came while the battle
for the large city of Wuhan raged in the summer of
1938.[^^[647]^^](#_ftn647) In northern China, a military academy was
established at Tongzhou in May, and some recruitment and direct training
was carried out. The North China Army referred to these soldiers as the
Peace Preservation Corps (治安隊) while in Chinese it sometimes went by
the name North China Pacification Army (華北綏靖軍). By October, 1940
this new army, which was to become the nucleus of a new national
military, had been granted responsibility for security in two counties
of Shandong and ten counties of Hebei province.[^^[648]^^](#_ftn648)

The Peace Preservation Corps was given the greatest proportion of
training and supplies but the North China Army placed greater confidence
in another collection of more local forces: provincial and county level
garrisons (警備隊). By 1940, Shandong province had 4,000 provincial
level garrison forces and there were a reported 72,000 at the county
level throughout occupied territory in the north; a reported average of
200 per county.[^^[649]^^](#_ftn649) As we shall see, Communist enemy
work teams found these local garrisons to be, by far, the easiest to win
over, but a 1940 Japanese report on their development was strangely
optimistic. Aiming to eventually have 300 in every county in northern
China, the fact that these forces were locally recruited was assumed to
ensure that they would take an active role in preventing infiltration by
resistance guerrillas.[^^[650]^^](#_ftn650)

Unfortunately, this tidy picture of the structure of collaborationist
forces composed of local garrisons and a nascent national army rapidly
breaks down. The Peace Preservation Corps (治安軍) could be found
operating in areas with other peace preservation units (保安隊) of
various scales. The new national army is sometimes referred to as the
“Peace and National Salvation Army,” (和平救國軍) but elsewhere we find
armies going by variations such as the “Peace and national construction
army” (和平建國軍) and “Peace and Communist Extermination Army”
(和平剿共軍). Its other local title, the North China Pacification Army
made it one of many other units supporting Japanese operations that
included “pacification” (綏靖) in their title that may have had no
direct connection to it. The Japanese military apparently attached the
name “Communist Extermination Army” to stronger units within the Peace
Preservation Corps, but some of the large and small units found in
accounts of the war in northern China went by similar terms, including
the similar “Communist Annihilation and National Construction Army”
(滅共建國軍), and may have arrived at their name
separately.[^^[651]^^](#_ftn651) The title “Assist the Emperor Army”
(皇協軍), also found throughout contemporary sources, was apparently
attached by the Japanese to surrendered Chinese forces that were of a
particularly poor quality. These units were to be temporarily supplied
while being reorganized or demobilized.[^^[652]^^](#_ftn652) At Japanese
surrender, over a dozen units including this title were operating in
Shandong alone. These included five divisions operating in the plains of
northwestern Shandong under the title “Assist the Emperor and Protect
the People Army” (皇協護民軍).[^^[653]^^](#_ftn653)

In the end, it is futile to reconstruct any sense of organization on
these armies, nor did their unity improve significantly with time. Quite
the opposite is true, especially in the aftermath of Japanese mopping-up
campaigns in northern China in 1941 and 1942. During this time, the
strongest and most active of the puppet armies to fight for Japan came
into being from a growing number of surrenders of units of Nationalist
forces, former bandits or small scale warlords. These units ranged in
size from a few dozen to over 20,000, and Communist guerrillas simply
referred to them by the names of their most important commanders, many
of whom were well-known military figures in the districts and provinces
they operated in.

Shandong offers a particularly rich environment to examine the response
to these various forms of military collaboration with Japan. The
province occupies the peninsula southeast of Beiping (now Beijing) and
includes the important ports of Qingdao, Yantai (Chefoo) and Weihaiwei
(now Weihai). The Japanese North China Army completed the conquest of
its major urban and strategic targets in the province by mid-1938.
During the occupation, the province was garrisoned by the Japanese 12th
Army and the most important military units to carry out operations in
the province at various points in the war were the 17th, 21st, 32nd,
35th, and 59th divisions along with the 5th, 6th, and 7th mixed
brigades. By the spring of 1945, almost all of the Shandong countryside
had been abandoned to Communist control. Only the Japanese 59th division
and the three mixed brigades remained in control of the cities and a
dwindling number of strongpoints near the main lines of
communication.[^^[654]^^](#_ftn654) After surrender, Communists claimed
control over 92% of the land area.[^^[655]^^](#_ftn655)

Note: Units in thousands. It is unclear which category includes those
areas under Nationalist control but by 1943, these would have been
relatively small in total area and population.

The peninsula offers a wartime setting which combined characteristics of
a number of other regions. It has both rich agricultural areas with
terrain that was relatively easy for the Japanese to operate in, large
cities with significant foreign populations, as well as rugged mountain
districts ideal for guerrilla activity. The Yimeng mountains in central
Shandong southeast of the provincial capital of Jinan and those of the
Jiaodong peninsula to the east became particularly important for the
resistance. These mountains became the two primary centers of Communist
guerrilla activity in Shandong while the western rim of the province
fell under the responsibility of a separate Communist military district
called the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region. Communist
organizational efforts in Shandong began with a series of uprisings
throughout the province in 1938 in which the Party played a leading or
important part. The resulting patchwork of Communist-led groups only
gradually united as sub-districts of a Shandong Base Area. Party control
in this new base area centered on a Shandong Provincial Sub-bureau while
the various local military units united under a “Shandong Column”
(山東縱隊). The Column later merged with the more professional 115th
Division of the famous 8th Route Army, which made its way into Shandong
in the spring of 1939.[^^[657]^^](#_ftn657)

As of 1939 the Communist resistance rarely sought out confrontations
with the Japanese occupation forces. The Shandong Sub-burea, under Zhu
Rui, focused on building up its strength and working towards
centralization. Instead, Communist soldiers in the province lost more
casualties in battles with the hundreds of thousands of Nationalist
forces that stayed behind in Shandong than with the invading
Japanese.[^^[658]^^](#_ftn658) It was the dwindling units of these
Nationalist forces and their own locally recruited Nationalist
guerrillas that would, in large part, defect to the Japanese. These
included forces under the overall command of Qin Qirong, Yu Xuezhong and
former Qingdao mayor Shen Honglie.[^^[659]^^](#_ftn659) The most rapid
growth of puppet armies in Shandong occurred between 1940 and 1943 when
they grew in number from an estimated 80,000 to
180,000.[^^[660]^^](#_ftn660) This coincides with the highly destructive
mopping-up campaigns carried out by the Japanese 12th Army in 1941 and
1942 that nearly succeeded in destroying the headquarters of the
Shandong Base Area and encircle the main body of both the Shandong
Column and the 115th Division. While Communist forces were able to
rebuild, Nationalist forces caught in these campaigns were not as
effective in restoring their strength and often switched sides to retain
their arms and organization. By 1943 most of the Nationalist forces that
had not switched to Japanese allegiance withdrew from the province, or
disintegrated under Communist attacks.

Even as its puppet armies exploded in size, the Japanese capacity to
deploy its own forces in strength declined. In 1942 and at a growing
pace thereafter, Japanese strength in many areas of occupied China was
increasingly sapped to meet the needs of its expanded conquests in
Southeast Asia and the Pacific.[^^[661]^^](#_ftn661) As the Imperial
Army’s expansion within China slowed, it was more important than ever to
consolidate control in its rear without the costly concentration of
large numbers of its own forces for mopping-up campaigns. Also, it was
equally important to quickly garrison areas that were newly deemed to
have been purged of resistance forces. The new puppet armies played a
key role in achieving both of these goals: they helped the Japanese
carry out their brutal counter-insurgency campaigns, and as each
district was cleared, assumed garrison duties.

None of the puppet armies were as well equipped and often far more
poorly trained than Japan’s Imperial Army. Even optimistic Japanese
reports on their performance always prefaced their hopes for the future
with the observation that in their current form they were not of
sufficient quality to be trusted to carry out operations without
Japanese assistance.[^^[662]^^](#_ftn662) More training was needed, it
was argued, and more time for them to become accustomed to the
challenging work of mopping-up guerrillas.[^^[663]^^](#_ftn663) Despite
their weakness, however, they did free up Japanese soldiers to operate
elsewhere. Even before their explosive growth in numbers began, the
ratio of puppet soldiers to Japanese soldiers in 1940 was three to one
in Shandong.[^^[664]^^](#_ftn664) By the following summer they were
garrisoning an estimated 800 forts or strongpoints throughout the
province.[^^[665]^^](#_ftn665) Even in one of the areas with high
concentrations of Japanese forces, the Jiaodong peninsula, a Communist
intelligence survey from 1944 listed 87 strongpoints occupied by the
Japanese (with a total of 8,364 soldiers) and 156 strategic points
manned by 21,879 puppet soldiers.[^^[666]^^](#_ftn666)

The puppet armies were most reviled for their violent repression and
pillage, as we shall see examples of shortly, but even without these
excesses, they were also significant in terms of the raw financial
burden they placed on the communities surrounding them. Their forces
added a further level of resource extraction in the form of taxes that,
depending on the district, could overlap with that of the Japanese,
Nationalist guerrillas still engaged in resistance, and Communist
forces. In December, 1942, the Shandong Sub-bureau produced a remarkably
detailed economic report on the relative financial burden of various
occupation forces on village life.[^^[667]^^](#_ftn667) This report
combined studies focused on several villages under various
circumstances, as well as a focus on a few individual families and
claimed that districts under puppet control had a financial burden more
than three times that of districts under Japanese control. The overall
compiled averages from the studies were summarized as follows.

The missing decimal points are added based on additional calculations
supplied in the description which followed the table. GMD districts are
those controlled by Nationalist guerrillas or regular army troops.

These amounts were not, for the most part, collected in cash, and these
estimates are based on the converted value of the various agricultural
products and raw materials appropriated. The resources and taxes
extracted in districts controlled by Nationalist forces was far higher
than those in puppet districts. These numbers do not, however, quantify
the labor corvée which, the report claimed, was most severe in puppet
and Japanese controlled districts.[^^[669]^^](#_ftn669) The most
contested areas unsurprisingly placed a particularly large cumulative
burden on its inhabitants due to extractions by all
parties.[^^[670]^^](#_ftn670)

These puppet armies had a reputation for cowardice and incompetence in
battle, but it would not be accurate to suggest that they merely sat
behind the safety of their fort walls, emerging only for the occasional
plunder or tax collection. They are mentioned in almost all accounts of
wartime battles involving Communist guerrillas and until the weakened
state of the Japanese occupation emboldened them, were the primary
target of many guerrilla attacks. Statistics for body counts in
Communist battle reports were undoubtedly widely exaggerated, but even
if they claimed double or more, they suggest that thousands of Chinese
puppet soldiers were dying in battles with Communist forces of Shandong
alone, at a rate that equal and sometimes higher than for Japanese
casualties.

Behind the front lines where Chiang Kai-shek’s battered forces held off
further Japanese advances, the Sino-Japanese war was as much a conflict
in which Chinese fought and killed their own fellow Chinese as one in
which the “Japanese devil” played the most visible villain. This fact is
usually pointed out in order to emphasize the bloody nature of a
conflict between the Communists and Nationalists as their Second United
Front collapsed. The costs in casualties from this civil war were
already significant in Shandong long before the New Fourth Army Incident
of 1941 brought the severity of the break between the two parties out
into the open.[^^[672]^^](#_ftn672) However, the scale of Chinese on
Chinese violence during the war is no less impressive if all Communist
battles with “stubborn army” (頑軍, the Nationalist forces) units that
still proclaimed the cause of resistance are excluded. Surrendered
Nationalist forces dominated many of the puppet armies, but this
designation overplays the attachment these surrendered forces had to the
ruling Nationalist party, an ideological anti-Communism, or for that
matter, a Chinese nation. The war between the puppet armies and their
mostly Communist adversaries simply cannot be seen as a continuation of
a great contest for supremacy between two well-formed political
adversaries, with the weaker Nationalist armies taking a “crooked path
to national salvation” (曲線救國) by surrendering to the Japanese. This
is not because Communist propaganda was wrong about the pragmatic, if
treasonous, intentions on the Nationalist side, but because it imagines
a degree of central control and selfless sacrifice to a national purpose
which does not fit most of Chiang Kai-shek’s “National Revolutionary
Army” in the 1930s.

In Shandong, a July 1945 Communist report estimated that puppet soldiers
had reached 200,000 in number, and that 80% of these were former
Nationalist soldiers.[^^[673]^^](#_ftn673) Time was quickly running out
for them. On 14 August, the day before Japan’s official surrender, the
Shandong Sub-bureau political commissioner Luo Ronghuan ordered that all
puppet armies and puppet employees who did not immediately surrender to
Communist resistance forces be eliminated. Attached to the order was a
long list of prominent members of the Japanese supported provincial
government and puppet armies in the province.[^^[674]^^](#_ftn674) The
list contained 57 military units and their commanders (See Appendix C).
Some 37 of these, or 65%, also added a note with the original
Nationalist army unit they belonged to before surrender. Not mentioned
in the note, however, was how recent these Nationalist army designations
themselves often were, or which local warlord, bandit group, or secret
society had once claimed their obedience. Most of all, what is missing
from statistics and lists of this kind, and their use in postwar
Communist propaganda focusing upon the connections between the puppet
armies and the Nationalists, is how “crooked” the path truly was for
many of these forces. To better understand this complex picture and to
anchor an examination of wartime and early postwar Communist policies
towards the puppet armies in Shandong, let us use the example of one
location, the district and later county of Laiwu, and separately, one
among the many puppet army commanders operating in Shandong, Wu Huawen.

*The Puppet Armies of Laiwu*

Laiwu county lies tucked in a valley just east of Taishan, one of the
most celebrated mountains in China. Part of the Luzhong area and
variously designated as a district or county by its various wartime
governments, Laiwu is surrounded on three sides by mountains but located
only a mere 110 kilometers southeast of the provincial capital Jinan.
Laiwu was overshadowed by the prominence of the nearby town of Tai’an
and its famous mountain, but was an important producer of coal and
valued for its yellow and white silk production.[^^[675]^^](#_ftn675) To
the north, a mountain pass connected it to the city of Zichuan on the
JiaoJi railway, the artery connecting Jinan with the port of Qingdao. To
the west beyond Tai’an lay the important north-south JinPu railway from
Tianjin to Pukou, just outside of Nanjing. The district had the
misfortune of being located in the shadow of the mountainous districts
that were home to many Communist forces, but also close enough to be
easily accessible by Japanese forces and their allies.

Laiwu offers a setting where a number of the differing forms of military
collaboration with Japan can be found as well as the interaction between
puppet armies, Nationalists, Communist forces, and other armed groups.
Japanese forces entered the county on 1 January, 1938. Only two days
later, local Communist party and other armed locals rose up in revolt
and within a week had joined forces with other revolts in nearby Tai’an
and the town of Xintai. Japanese troops continued their progress south
in February without leaving a garrison, but no sooner had they left than
Nationalist guerrillas under Qin Qirong entered the district and fought
a series of battles with the local Communist-led resistance. A semblance
of a “united front” between Communists and Nationalists was only
restored with help from the Nationalist 69th Corps commander, the former
warlord Shi Yousan, who helped local Communist forces expel his supposed
ally Qin from the district.[^^[676]^^](#_ftn676)

In August, 1939, a resistance government was formally established for
Laiwu in the southeastern mountain village of Zhujiazhuang under
Communist Party member and guerrilla leader Tan Keping. A county
magistrate appointed by the Nationalist forces in 1940, the avowed
anti-Communist Liu Boge, also claimed to represent the county. Finally,
the Japanese army, which had reestablished some presence in the county
by late 1938, strengthened its grip on the county beginning in
September, 1940 by building up local strong points and recruiting
military collaborators from the area. There were now three contending
centers of power, a Communist led county government in Zhujiazhuang, Liu
Boge’s Nationalist county government, and a Japanese supported county
administration.

Almost as soon as it had established local strongpoints, the Japanese
Army carried out its first major mopping-up operation in the county.
Communist sources claim that some 360 civilians were killed in 25
separate Japanese massacres during this campaign. By 1943, however, the
Japanese sponsored county government was deeply infiltrated by
Communists. Some of the county administrators were in fact Communist
Party members who had sought out their positions under the Japanese
following a policy of “white skin, red heart”
(白皮紅心).[^^[677]^^](#_ftn677) As a result, much of the county
remained effectively under Communist Party control until the end of the
war, even as puppet armies and Japanese troops continued to occupy
strong points in the county seat of Laicheng and a few other locations
such as Kouzhen and Luxi villages.

This triangular distribution of power in the county between Communist,
Nationalist, and Japanese-sponsored administrations, can be found in
many Japanese-occupied areas in northern China, but the simplification
is only possible by subsuming a number of other armed groups under
either the Japanese or Nationalist corner of the triangle, or else
classifying them as apolitical bandits. Doing so underplays the
independence and strength of local actors that may have shifted
allegiance several times during the conflict. Religious sects and rural
self-defense associations were, for example, important players.

Four or five distinct armed groups in Laiwu eventually fought together
with Japanese occupation forces and they ranged in size and the breadth
of their support in the communities they came from. A county level
security battalion and a county garrison are referred to in a number of
sources, but it is not clear if these were separate organizations. The
former is described as mostly made of up of soldiers who were not from
the county, and were of poor quality. One of these units deserted in
1943. In 1945 many of them retreated into Anhui province, while those
that remained revolted on behalf of Communist forces and attacked the
Japanese supported county government. A “Revive Asia and Eliminate
Communism Army” (興亞剿共軍) was also established, headed by a local
bandit named Yan Jiguang and an “intellectual,” Liu Yaonan as his second
in command. Its other officers were said to include local merchants, and
was alleged to operate an intelligence network in the county that
depended on its traders, but the whole army was merged into the county
controlled security battalion in 1942.[^^[678]^^](#_ftn678) The security
battalion, local garrison, and Yan’s bandit army are unlikely to have
had much broad support.

The more formidable, and dangerous, of the puppet armies in Laiwu came
from organizations that predated the war and could command stronger
loyalties from its thousands of members across multiple villages in the
county. In the mountainous east of Laiwu, an “Eliminate Communism
Autonomous Army” (剿共自治軍) operated under the command of one Zhang
Wenzheng.[^^[679]^^](#_ftn679) Zhang was the “great teacher” and leader
of the local branch of the “Middle Way” (中央道) religious sect, which
was active in over 20 counties of Shandong. There are two versions of
how the followers of the Middle Way in Laiwu. Communist sources, some of
which where used to suppress the sect in the early 1950s, claims that
around 1,800 followers of Zhang fought on behalf of the resistance with
a Nationalist commander operating further south, Zhang Liyuan, but that
they later transferred to the control of two important commanders who
eventually surrendered to the Japanese, Zhang Buyun and Wu Huawen. By
the time the army of the Middle Way had joined Wu Huawen’s forces, most
likely when he was stationed in Laiwu, they had dwindled to some 500 men
and were of little use. Their leader Zhang Wenzheng was killed by
Communist forces in 1945.[^^[680]^^](#_ftn680)

A 1947 Nationalist report on puppet armies in Laiwu tells the story of
the Middle Way somewhat differently. It claimed that early in the war
against Japan, the Middle Way followers first fought in league with
local Communist forces but, following disagreements, they were expelled
from the county and surrendered to the Japanese in 1941. They then
returned to Laiwu and grew in strength to about 3,000 rifles with
Japanese support. The Middle Way then turned upon their former allies
and were responsible for the capture and killing of hundreds of members
of the “treasonous Party” (the Nationalist term for the Communist
Party). Part of their army was dispersed by the Japanese in 1942 on
suspicion of working secretly with the resistance, while the remainder
was wiped out by Communist forces in 1946, after Japanese
surrender.[^^[681]^^](#_ftn681)

The Middle Way was not the only organization of its kind in Laiwu that
may have changed sides when its allies proved worse than its enemies.
One of the best known wartime organizations in Laiwu was the army of the
“Hard Fist Society” (硬拳道), which was connected to the Red Spears
   (紅槍會) movement. This organization, also with a strong religious
element, was one of many in a complex world of rural defense
associations and religious societies found throughout Shandong and
northern China. The Hard Fist society was, like other Red Spear
societies, led by local elites, but had wide community participation. It
grew rapidly in the 1920s in Shandong, where the “Hard Fist Society”
resisted warlord and bandit violence and appropriations in rural areas.
Both Nationalist and Communist sources agree this time that the Laiwu
based Hard Fist Society began the war in alliance with the Communist-led
revolt. They were predominantly active in western Laiwu, especially
around the village of Luxi where they worked together with the
resistance movement until late 1939. It was then that the relationship
fell apart, thanks to the “leftist deviations” of the Communist Traitor
Elimination Bureau (鋤奸部).

The year 1939 was already a bad one for Treason Elimination Bureau
agents who, at this point, focused more on rooting out Party heterodoxy
than exposing enemy spies and punishing collaborators. These were as
often as not simply referred to as traitors, or traitors to the Han
people, *hanjian* (漢奸). By the end of the year, the provincial Party
Sub-Bureau was reeling from that news that over 300 executions of
accused Trotskyists had been carried out by bureau agents in southern
Shandong during the widely condemned witch-hunt that became known as the
“Huxi Incident.”[^^[682]^^](#_ftn682) In Laiwu, the Hard Fist Society
became the target of the Bureau. Treason elimination cadres executed two
of the society’s leaders and beat other prominent figures in the
organization. Suspicion and factional strife broke out and the head of
the society, Qi Xiangde, fled the county and went over to the Japanese
in September, 1940. Qi was just in time to help the Japanese in their
new efforts to strengthen control in Laiwu and, with their support, he
returned to gather his followers and create around half a dozen separate
armed units.[^^[683]^^](#_ftn683)

Until the Hard Fist Society retreated into Anhui province as the
Japanese surrender neared, they were a menace to both Communist and
Nationalist forces in Laiwu. Communist sources claim that they included
around 1,000 armed followers, while the 1947 Nationalist government
report claims that they had 7,000 followers of which 2,000 had firearms.
The postwar Nationalist report claims they often carried out nighttime
assassinations of resistance leaders and members of a Nationalist youth
group. A Communist source claims the Hard Fist Society broke up 100
Party branches, coerced 600 party members to give themselves up to the
Japanese, and killed around 400 members of the
resistance.[^^[684]^^](#_ftn684) After the war Qi and the Hard Fist
Society’s remained in Laiwu in service of the returning Nationalists as
an autonomous unit. When Qi’s unit was captured by Communists in 1947,
he was executed for the society’s wartime crimes.

In Laiwu, there was no shortage of bandit figures or ragtag soldiers
serving in the Japanese supported county garrison. In this county,
however, the most serious threats from the puppet armies supporting the
Japanese occupation came in the form of local institutions with local
ambitions for power and a reason to carry out violence in the name of
vengeance. Communist Party propaganda deployed a patriotic rhetoric
describing a national problem of puppetry: armies filled with deceived
and drafted farmers, of heartless bandits, and of urban ruffians who
were betraying their country through ignorance, desperation, or a
propensity for cruelty. In places like Laiwu, however, local Communist
Party resistance forces faced circumstances that came nowhere near to
fitting this picture and its Enemy Work Bureau, tasked with winning them
over to the resistance, adapted accordingly.

*            Wu Huawen’s Crooked Road to National Salvation*

Laiwu offers a look at how important the particular circumstances of a
locality is in understanding the challenges faced by the resistance,
whether it was Communist or Nationalist in its leadership, in tackling
the phenomenon of military collaboration. Sometimes, however, the
personality and ambitions of a single commander could be as important a
factor as the complex workings of county society. In both Nationalist
and Communist accounts of the wartime years in Shandong province it is
the remarkable personalities and terrifying deeds of the leading
warlords which stand out. They include the Shandong bandit Liu Guitang,
who had already earned infamy fighting and pillaging as far afield as
inner Mongolia before returning to his home province to fight under both
Nationalist and Japanese orders. He was killed in 1943 at the hand of
local communist forces and his body was paraded around the communities
who bore a deep hatred of him.[^^[685]^^](#_ftn685) There was Zhang
Buyun, a general who served under the commander of nationalist forces in
Shandong Han Fuju until Han was executed by Chiang Kai-shek for refusing
to follow orders to halt the Japanese advance into the province. Zhang
became one of the first major commanders to surrender to the invading
army and remained active in Japanese service even at the end of the war.
He is remembered in Shandong for a number of brutal massacres carried
out during mop up operations in the spring of 1945. A more complex
figure was Zhang Tianzuo, the former police chief of Changle county who
discovered a way to simultaneously hold military commissions from both
the Nationalist army and the Japanese through an act of mutual
deception. Undoubtedly, however the most unique figure of them all was
Zhang Zongyuan. Born in 1892 as Date Junnosuke in Japan, Zhang took on
Chinese citizenship in 1931. He called himself a *Luren*(魯人), a person
from Shandong, and fought for a wide variety of causes, including
independence for his beloved Shandong. When Japan occupied the province,
Zhang assumed the titular head of many of its puppet armies.

One of the commanders whose forces had a relatively wide field of action
in Shandong and had frequent occasion to clash with the Communist
Shandong Column and the Eighth Route Army’s 115th Division is Wu Huawen.
When Japanese forces flowed into Shandong in 1937, Wu was a subordinate
of Han Fuju, the Nationalist commander executed for his unwillingness to
defend the province.[^^[686]^^](#_ftn686) For years thereafter he
continued to serve the Nationalist forces who remained behind in the
province as part of the Civilian Intelligence Guerrillas commanded by
Qin Qirong, who we saw fighting with the Communist resistance in Laiwu.
Wu commanded tens of thousands of soldiers in a New Fourth Division that
was one of the largest and strongest cohesive units among the
Nationalist forces in the province. Together with Qin Qirong and Shen
Honglie, he was one of the core leaders of provincial Nationalist power
to remain behind during the occupation. The relative freedom with which
a large Nationalist division under Wu could move across Shandong
province without major battles with the Japanese is an example of the
extremely porous nature of Japanese control in the large province. In
1938 Wu served under Shen in southwestern Shandong but late in the year
moved to the north of the province, before being relocated to southern
Shandong again the following year and eventually focusing his operations
around the Yimeng mountains that encircled Laiwu district.

In August, 1940 to the forces of Wu Huawen and Shen Honglie launched
multiple attacks on a detachment of the Communist Shandong Column around
Lucun, just east of Laiwu. Each time the attacks came as the Japanese
were launching their own attacks on the detachment. Events such as these
led to accusations that Wu Huawen and Shen were coordinating their
actions against Communist forces with the Japanese. This may well have
been the case, but what could seem to one side as insidious cooperation
could, to another, be seen as attacks of opportunity based on
intelligence. When Nationalist forces came under strong pressure from
Japanese and puppet army attacks in later years, the 115th Division
enthusiastically finished the job by eliminating most of the remnants of
the attacks.

If the suspicious timing of Wu’s attacks on Shandong Column had already
earned him a reputation for betraying the cause of resistance and
anti-Communist fervor, his reputation grew even worse by the following
year in the area around Zichuan, just beyond the northern pass out of
Laiwu. There, the atrocities of Wu’s soldiers earned his army the
nickname “Fresh Corpses” (xīnsĭshī 新死屍) in a play on the name “New
Fourth Division” (xīnsìshī 新四師). By mid-1942, Communist reports noted
that Wu’s forces were confiscating ever larger amounts of materials from
the local populace, which they took to mean that he was running low on
supplies.[^^[687]^^](#_ftn687) After a two day battle between Communist
units and Wu’s forces in late 1942, it was noted that the New Fourth
Division had grown markedly weaker when compared to earlier attacks.
Squeezed between the Japanese and Communist forces in the mountainous
areas, the very survival of his army as an independent force was in
question.

In January, 1943 Wu Huawen turned his fortunes around and defected to
the Japanese. His New Fourth Division was reorganized and Wu was placed
in command of a Third Army of Peace and National Construction. He almost
immediately launched attacks on his former allies, in the form of the
Nationalist forces under the commander Yu Xuezhong. Wu’s defection had a
powerful impact on Nationalist fortunes in Shandong, forcing its
provincial government and most of its remaining organized resistance to
withdraw from the province.[^^[688]^^](#_ftn688)

Beyond the impact of Wu’s defection on Nationalist military and
political presence, his armies reputation for atrocities and causing
devastation increased. In February, 1943 Wu Huawen’s division moved into
the district of Linqu, over the mountain northeast of Laiwu. In his
wartime diary, Feng Yizhi, then sub-commander of a local regiment of the
115th Division stationed in the area, claims the district was laid to
waste when Wu moved in, transforming it into a “no-man’s land” (無人區)
as the refugees flowed out of the district or starved. Feng’s unit moved
in to provide relief in the aftermath but found only abandoned villages
and a few “wandering ghosts” along the road. Feng claimed he had never
seen such devastation up to this point. Between the dead and those who
had fled, only ten households remained out of around a hundred in the
village he set up his base and his unit had to bury the bodies of the
dead themselves. Those that survived blamed Wu.

Merely bringing up the name of Wu Huawen brings forth both grief and
hatred. They say he is not a human but a demon. He brought upon the
people unprecedented disaster. What made their hate even more impossible
to placate was the fact that not only did he cause so much damage but
had also surrendered to the enemy and become a traitor. Gnashing their
teeth they said, “If Wu Huawen was captured, covered with oil and lit on
fire, it still could not purge our hatred.”[^^[689]^^](#_ftn689)

Laiwu also remembers Wu Huawen for the atrocities of his armies. For
part of 1944, Wu was based in eastern Laiwu and it was forces under his
command that was responsible for the “Xujiadian Massacre,” the single
largest massacre of civilians to occur in the district during the war.
One of Wu’s battalions, commanded by Ma Zhengyuan, were attacked by
Communist forces. After the attack they surrounded the two nearby
villages of Xujiadian and Xiachen to carry out retribution. They were
set alight and the inhabitants attacked indiscriminately. According to a
local gazetteer, those killed included an eight year old girl thrown in
the fire, an eleven year old beaten to death, and others shot, stabbed,
or thrown into the village well. Altogether 34 villagers were killed and
21 injured, over five hundred homes burned, and the crops in the field,
leading to starvation and another 35 dead within a
year.[^^[690]^^](#_ftn690)

Wu was always able to escape the oil and fire his victims might have
wished for him. His forces grew to be the strongest unit among the
puppet armies in Shandong by 1944.[^^[691]^^](#_ftn691) By the end of
the war, however, he had lost more than half of his strength in three
“Attack Wu Campaigns” launched by the Communist 115th or to defections
and desertions.[^^[692]^^](#_ftn692) Along with many other puppet
armies, he withdrew out of the province to the south in the summer of
1945.

Despite his prominent role in crushing the remnants of Nationalist
strength in the province, Wu was welcomed back by Chiang Kai-shek in
1945 and his forces were reorganized, leaving him in command. Wu was
unhappy with the terms and supplies given to him, and at least one
returning Nationalist general in Shandong, Li Yannian, wanted Wu tried
as a traitor.[^^[693]^^](#_ftn693) His ability to avoid prosecution may
have been thanks to secret assistance he provided to the nationalist
Nationalist intelligence organization, the Military Statistics bureau,
or *juntong* (軍統) in the last months of the war. At the treason trial
of Zhou Fohai (周佛海), one of the top three leaders of the Japanese
wartime client regime established in Nanjing, a *juntong* officer Zhou
Gao (周鎬) testified that he had secured the defection of Wu Huawen, and
several other leading puppet officers in the fall of
1944.[^^[694]^^](#_ftn694)

From 1946-1948 Wu hedged his bets and developed contacts with the
Communist forces that occupied most of Shandong province. When his
forces in the provincial capital of Jinan, which was virtually
surrounded for much of the civil war, came under attack in the fall
1948, Wu immediately defected to his Communist attackers with his men,
making any further defense of the city impossible. Nationalist control
in Shandong collapsed with this act of betrayal and an American marine
presence in Qingdao was all that kept that last Shandong city safe until
the following year.

Both Mao Zedong and Zhu De congratulated Wu for his timely defection in
a telegram after the fall of Jinan and Wu was allowed to continue to
command his own men, though likely under the strong influence of his
appointed political commissar, He Kexi. Wu’s reorganized army
immediately joined the sweep south during the final stage of the civil
war. New battles fought with the revolutionary army provided a means of
repentance for past sins. The reverse of this phenomenon was seen only a
decade earlier when thousands of Spaniards with left-wing pasts cleaned
their slate by fighting for the Nationalists in the late stages of the
Spanish civil war.[^^[695]^^](#_ftn695)

When soldiers raised the red flag on the roof of the Nationalist
government headquarters in Nanjing in 1949, a famous scene reminiscent
of the Soviet capture of the Reichstag in Berlin in 1945, it was
soldiers in Wu’s 35th Army who carried it out. By this time, however, it
was no longer the warlord’s personal army and had absorbed thousands of
other troops. The unit that captured the capital building had fought
against Wu during the war of resistance in the Communist 115th Division,
only to later find themselves nominally under his command and fighting
side by side with Wu’s old troops in the 35th Army’s 104th Division.

The defections of Wu Huawen were not unique, nor was the fate of his
soldiers in the vanguard of the southern advance of the Communists. If
anything, his transfers of loyalty, the violence and devastation caused
by his forces, and the Communist approach to this forces are found
repeated in the experience of many puppet armies in Shandong. As we
shall see, beyond Wu’s many twists of fortune and the dramatic impact of
his 1948 defection, his forces were the active targets of the Communist
policy towards puppet armies. Its best known victory might have been at
the walls of a besieged Jinan during the civil war, but just as
important were the more piecemeal efforts to win over Wu’s forces in
towns and fortresses across the province during the long war of
resistance against Japan. The approaches to this effort varied, but the
fundamental principal behind this effort begin with Mao Zedong himself.

*Puppet Army Policy and the Seven Captures of Meng Huo*

In a letter to his New Fourth Army commander Chen Yi and its political
commissar Liu Shaoqi on 17 August, 1941, Mao answered their request for
an official Communist policy towards puppet troops fighting for the
Japanese. The party should, he said, patiently follow the policy of
‘seven times capturing Meng Huo.’”[^^[696]^^](#_ftn696) Four chapters of
the Romance of the Three Kingdoms are dedicated to the story of how the
brilliant strategist Zhuge Liang suppressed a rebellion in the south of
the kingdom Shu, in modern day Sichuan province.[^^[697]^^](#_ftn697)
The rebellion was sparked and sustained by the forces of the Man tribe
under their king Meng Huo. After defeating the Man in battle Zhuge
captured the fleeing king in an ambush. When asked what he would do if
he was released, Meng said he would raise his troops to fight again, but
if captured a second time he would submit. Zhuge released Meng Huo
despite the protests of his commanders. To these Zhuge replied, “I can
catch him again with ease whenever I choose to. But the pacification of
the south requires that we subdue the hearts of the Man
people.”[^^[698]^^](#_ftn698) In the chapters that followed, Man was
captured time and again, but five times he reneged on his promise to
submit to the Shu and end the rebellion. Finally, on his seventh
capture, Meng Huo and his family swore the south would not rebel again,
“For generations to come, our children and theirs after them will
gratefully acknowledge your all-protecting, all-sustaining love, deep as
Heaven, vast as earth.”[^^[699]^^](#_ftn699)

This most likely apocryphal story of Meng Huo’s repeated capture is
mentioned in several sources but found in most detail in the influential
Three Kingdoms romance.[^^[700]^^](#_ftn700) Though the four character
compound ‘seven times capturing Meng Huo’ (七擒孟獲) has been
interpreted in more abstract terms since. There is nothing to suggest
Mao was thinking of the old anecdote the saying came from when he used
it in 1941, but the parallel between the old story and his proposed
policy is striking:

In principal, whether they are officers or soldiers and no matter what
social background they come from, no puppet troop captives are to be
killed. Even those elements who have a deep hatred for us and come back
to fight us again after being released may be spared execution. That is,
the method of repeated capturing and releasing is better than killing,
and its impact is greater. In releasing captives, there should be
absolutely no posting of bail, and they should not be made to vow that
they will never be puppet soldiers in the future. But they can be
required to swear that they will not really help the Japanese oppose the
New Fourth Army in the future. And if they do actually violate their
oath and help Japan fight us, then we should still patiently carry out
the policy of “seven times capturing Meng Huo.”[^^[701]^^](#_ftn701)

This position had evolved over the course of the opening years of the
war against Japan. Mao’s own directives emphasized the importance of the
task of “winning over and disintegrating”        (爭取瓦解) puppet
armies at least as early as his “On the New Stage” report to the Sixth
Plenum of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in
October, 1938.[^^[702]^^](#_ftn702) In November, he directed that
political subversion of puppet regime troops seek to maximize the
long-term impact on the enemy. When puppet troops were won over cadres
were to “strive to bring them nominally under the command of the Eighth
Route Army, and then transform or reorganize them during a process of
struggle…”[^^[703]^^](#_ftn703)

In late 1940 Mao offered more specific instructions on releasing
captured puppets. At this point, however, while the basic policy was to
“set them all free,” he allowed for the execution of military
collaborators that had “incurred the bitter hatred to the
masses.”[^^[704]^^](#_ftn704) By May, 1941, the policy had come to
settle upon the Meng Huo inspired policy of extreme leniency. In a
directive to forces the Shaanxi-Ganzu-Ningxia border region cadres were
even ordered to forgo attempts to force those captured to show
repentance and removed the possibility of retribution against those
guilty of particularly heinous crimes. As in the case of his
instructions to the New Fourth Army, in the cases of both captured enemy
and puppet army soldiers, commanders were to, “carry out a policy of
leniency in all cases, regardless of the individual’s situation…under no
circumstances may they be killed, humiliated, forced to confess, or
forced to compose statements of repentance. Those who are recaptured
after having been released, regardless how many times they have been
captured, are all to be dealt with in this manner.”[^^[705]^^](#_ftn705)

The other important figure in establishing policies towards puppet
forces was the head of the Eighth Route Army, Zhu De. He had a long
military career before becoming a close associate of Mao Zedong in 1928
and was no stranger to military defections. As a graduate of the Yunnan
military academy, he betrayed his own Qing army to participate in the
Yunnan army revolt in October, 1911. Already during this earlier
revolution he used subversion to persuade other Qing soldiers to defect
to the Republican forces.[^^[706]^^](#_ftn706) Again in 1916, while
serving the Yunnan warlord Cai E during the National Protection War, Zhu
helped secure the defection of thousands of Sichuan troops to join the
cause of Cai’s National Protection Army (護國軍).[^^[707]^^](#_ftn707)
As a commander of ostensibly Nationalist troops in 1927, Zhu supported a
Communist military insurrection in Nanchang before again briefly
integrating his troops into those of the warlord and Nationalist
commander Fan Shisheng. While Mao had looked to the *Three Kingdoms* for
inspiration, Zhu could simply look back upon his own career.

In his 1938 essay “On Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War” Zhu De discussed the
importance of political warfare against military collaborators. Many of
the rank and file and some of the officers among both the Japanese and
their collaborators were “unwilling to die for the Japanese conquest of
China.” Political tactics, therefore, should be used to compel the
puppets to “turn their guns against the Japanese warlords and the
Chinese traitors.”[^^[708]^^](#_ftn708) In a later essay from April,
1945, Zhu took a more flexible approach than the unconditional mercy Mao
proposed and suggested that a diverse range of approaches be taken,
urging cadres not to, “apply one hard and fast rule to all puppet
troops.” While the diehards were to be destroyed, officers and men who
were only “temporarily fooled” by the enemy should be won over. They
were to be warned, however, that time was running out. “These puppets
have committed many crimes. Unless they cross over to our side soon,
they will not have time to serve their country and redeem themselves;
and they will be punished as the nation demands.”[^^[709]^^](#_ftn709)
The puppets would have to, as British commanders claimed the Burma
National Army did in the spring of 1945, “work their passage home” by
joining the war of resistance.

*The Enemy and Puppet Work Bureau in Shandong*

The general policies set out by Mao and Zhu for dealing with puppets
were tasked to an Enemy and Puppet Work Bureau (敵偽工作部). In
Shandong, a 1940 guide outlined the goals for developing the Bureau in
the base area.[^^[710]^^](#_ftn710) The task was urgent, it was argued,
given the large number of points puppet armies already occupied and the
fact that there were three times as many puppet soldiers as Japanese
ones in the province. Separate Enemy and Work Committees were to be set
up for each provincial-level administrative division (行政區),
commissioner’s administrative region    (專員區, the equivalent of the
older provincial “circuits” or *dao*道 system used by the
collaborationist government), and the county (*xian*縣) levels.

These committees were to consist of five members, including a committee
head, one staff assistant, one propaganda specialist, one intelligence
officer, and one cadre dedicated to operations. The intelligence officer
was to focus on collecting information about “internal contradictions”
among enemy and puppet forces as well as capture documents that could be
of use to the efforts of winning them over. Operations officers were to
focus on the creation and management of relationships with puppet army
units and agents that had infiltrated their ranks.

Enemy and Puppet Work Committees did not only work with puppet armies,
but also with Japanese and Korean soldiers in the Imperial army. It took
advantage of a small number of cadres who had studied in Japan or had
otherwise gained Japanese language experience. Japanese and Koreans who
defected to the Communists joined anti-war leagues that continued
propaganda efforts against the Japanese occupation. These efforts did
not yield the results achieved with Chinese puppet armies. Defections
among the Japanese were extremely low in number, and even limited
relationships with Chinese military collaborators could yield
significant intelligence and other benefits that were less likely to be
gained from the occupying army. In Shandong, the Enemy Work Bureau did
have higher hopes, however, for their work with Korean soldiers. When
there was an influx of Korean volunteer recruits (志願兵) into the
Japanese 32nd and 59th divisions in the spring of 1944, it was hoped
that these Koreans retained sufficient “national or ethnic
consciousness” (民族意識) to make them susceptible to overtures from the
resistance.[^^[711]^^](#_ftn711) Captured Koreans were to be separated
from Japanese prisoners and treated according to the lenient policy for
puppet armies, with the exception of those captured as
spies.[^^[712]^^](#_ftn712)

Throughout the war, and even before Mao and Zhu clarified the Party’s
policy, the official approach in Shandong was already one of
leniency.[^^[713]^^](#_ftn713) Puppet soldiers were not to be insulted
or criticized. They were not to be searched, and they were to be offered
preferential medical treatment. Weapons were to be confiscated, and
while they were to receive political education, those that requested to
return home were to be released, escorted to the district border, and
given travel funds.[^^[714]^^](#_ftn714) The importance of the policy on
the peninsula grew after Communist controlled areas came under heavy
attack in the most ambitious mopping up campaigns by the Japanese in
1941.[^^[715]^^](#_ftn715) This already lenient policy had become even
more generous by the summer of 1945, even as Japanese surrender neared.
For those puppet armies that surrendered or secretly aided the
resistance, cadres were to offer “the three guarantees”: “1) to be
treated as allies in the war against resistance and not be disarmed; 2)
to be given a unit designation in the army of resistance and not be
disbanded; 3) to be treated without discrimination and be permitted to
further expand as they fought together in the war of
resistance.”[^^[716]^^](#_ftn716)

Cadres in the Enemy Work Bureau were instructed to first attempt to
develop ties with officers of a puppet army unit, and if that did not
work attempt a bottom up approach. Attempts to secretly infiltrate the
lower ranks of puppet armies had been made throughout the war, but it
was deemed an inefficient approach. Instead, Communist infiltrators in
puppet units served primarily as liaisons with the Party and their
identity was known to officers in the targeted unit.

When a relationship was developed with a puppet officer, they were
classified either as “two-sided type” (兩面派) or “two-sided
revolutionary type” (兩面革命派) puppets. The latter were seen as
reluctant collaborators that were in fact patriotic supporters of the
war of resistance that were additionally sympathetic to the revolution.
Greater care was taken in working with the former, who were seen as
having a reactionary character who were merely acting out of
self-interest. For these, an effective mix of the carrot and the stick
was to be used combining attacks on their forces with efforts to secure
their cooperation. “As you beat them, seduce them; as you draw them in,
beat them; beat them and draw them in again and again. When you beat
them don’t beat them so hard that you destroy the relationship. As you
draw them in, don’t lose your own position.”[^^[717]^^](#_ftn717)

Cadres of the bureau were encouraged to be generous in the giving of
gifts in order to gain the friendship and trust of a puppet army as long
as they did not offer them opium, flour, or prostitutes. When drawing a
puppet army unit in, cadres were not to set their goals too high. It was
not necessary to secure the defection of all puppet armies. Instead,
getting them to remain neutral, passive, and relatively inactive was
itself a success.[^^[718]^^](#_ftn718) Even in cases where a targeted
unit was willing to come over, it was not always permitted. It was
recommended that a unit only come over if they were found out by the
Japanese, they were soon to be reorganized or merged into another unit,
or they were deployed in an assault. The full defection of a unit was to
be avoided when it contained a large number of bandit elements that
would be difficult to manage, or when it was deemed difficult for the
Party to establish control over the territory they were responsible
for.[^^[719]^^](#_ftn719)

We can see how the carrot and stick approach was supposed to work in the
memoirs of Wang Fang, head of the Enemy Work Bureau in the Luzhong
military district that included Laiwu and the areas where Wu Huawen was
active. Wang targeted one of Wu’s battalions that had been involved in
raids in Mengyin and Boshan, which lay just to the south and north of
Laiwu, respectively. The force had about 500 men and was commanded by a
former bandit named Liu Mingjiu well known, according to Wang, for his
propensity for opium, prostitutes, pillage, and killing. Liu’s men were
deeply loyal to him, however, and he claimed to follow a code of honor.
It was decided that, despite his past violence, the Bureau would “light
a fire in his backyard” and then let him come over to the Eighth Route
Army.

Wang travelled to Liu’s fortress together with a company of soldiers.
Leaving his men disbursed around the fortress, he approached the gate
dressed in a captured uniform together with a Japanese speaking
interpreter, and was let into the fortress. He then revealed himself as
an agent of the resistance and demanded the surrender of the fortress,
declaring it to be surrounded. The commander offered his hospitality and
together the two feasted and attempted to out-drink each other.
Commander Liu was informed by his own men that an unknown number of
soldiers did indeed surround his fortress and Wang combined threats of
imminent destruction with appeals to the virtues of joining the
resistance over the course of two days of debate. In the end Liu
surrendered with all his men and the story of Wang’s successful use of
deception and persuasion spread spread Wang’s reputation throughout the
district. In a formal ceremony, Liu’s unit was given a new designation
as an independent battalion in the resistance army, and Liu was allowed
to remain as second in command of his own troops.[^^[720]^^](#_ftn720)

How much of this story, which echoes so many similar stories of daring
deception found in Chinese military tales, is true is difficult to
determine, but Wang offers a sad ending to his tale. The old bandit Liu
“could not handle our discipline” and his “old disease flared up again.”
Liu and his soldiers deserted the resistance to collaborate once again
with the Japanese. He was later captured, shot, and his unit
disbanded.[^^[721]^^](#_ftn721) Puppet armies that were captured and
requested release might be captured again without facing execution, but
unlike the Nationalist government, the Communist Party was far less
forgiving of those who once joined the Eighth Route Army’s forces and
then betrayed its ranks. Treason against the nation—at least under its
Nationalist government—and service of the Japanese was one thing, but to
betray the Party was another. Though the Communist Party sought to win
over Chinese puppet soldiers and Koreans alike through an appeal to
“national consciousness,” a new life in the Communist-led resistance was
to be a one way street.

*Megaphones and Frontline Propaganda***

Don't shoot,

Listen to me sing the surrender song.

Brothers, listen carefully [repeat]

We are all Chinese,

One! Don't hate. Two! Don't hate.

Why do you fight your own people? [repeat]

The Japanese devils have come to our home,

Who wants to serve as their beasts of burden?

If you want to be a soldier you should kill the enemy. [repeat]

The wild warlords act beyond the bounds of reason,

and turn their guns upon themselves.

If you want to be a soldier fight the Japanese,

Recover our lost territory and enjoy peace.

          “The Surrender Song” from Laiwu District[^^[722]^^](#_ftn722)

One of the most direct ways to win over puppet armies was through
frontline propaganda. This could, of course, come in the form of written
appeals. In Qinghe, Binhai, and Jiaodong military districts alone
Communist forces distributed 160,000 copies of 52 different propaganda
items to puppet armies.[^^[723]^^](#_ftn723) During the three campaigns
against Wu Huawen letters were sent to his officers pleading with them
to come over. “Wu Huawen’s wild ambition forced you to become traitors,”
one began, “We welcome you to return to our side. Together we can fight
the war of resistance and eliminate the great traitor who cheated you:
Wu Huawen.”[^^[724]^^](#_ftn724) Because many of the soldiers in puppet
armies were illiterate, however written propaganda had its
limits.[^^[725]^^](#_ftn725)

The most effective frontline communication with an enemy force that
Communist forces had no direct or indirect relationship with was through
the use of nighttime calls through a megaphone (喊話). Hiding in various
locations around a puppet army strong point, these propaganda calls,
songs, and chants that were carried out for hours at a time were used to
demoralize the enemy through appeals to surrender, threats of future
punishment, and the sharing of propaganda news on developments
throughout Shandong.

An account of the application of megaphone propaganda against Wu
Huawen’s forces can be found in Wang Fang’s memoir. In the winter of
1943, after the completion of the first “Attack Wu Campaign,” Wang
personally joined an effort to secure the surrender of some Wu’s troops
in a remote fortress. He called out to the enemy, telling them they
could join the Eighth Route Army if they only put their weapons down,
and that if, instead, they wished to return to their homes, the Eighth
Route Army would gladly pay them their traveling expenses. After 30
minutes of these megaphone appeals, shots were fired from the fort,
forcing him to relocate. Wang claims that, after another hour of calls
from his new location, all 200 of the puppet soldiers inside
surrendered.[^^[726]^^](#_ftn726)

It wasn’t necessary for an enemy unit to surrender to claim a positive
result. In Laiwu, an Enemy Work team under Yu Zizheng carried out
megaphone propaganda against one puppet army fort. The fort did not
surrender but a friendly relationship was successfully developed. When
Japanese forces next carried out a mopping-up campaign in the area,
local resistance members were allowed to hide in the
fortress.[^^[727]^^](#_ftn727) Megaphone propaganda, sometimes called
offering “night school,” (上夜課), became an ever increasing part of
efforts to win over puppet armies.[^^[728]^^](#_ftn728) By 1944 they had
also expanded to include more than just dedicated Enemy Work agents. In
southern Shandong, the activity was apparently deemed safe enough a
practice that children were given lessons on propaganda calls to the
enemy and, “at night they would call out to the puppet armies not to
steal their food.”[^^[729]^^](#_ftn729)

Broadcasted or shouted propaganda along a long linear front cannot match
the isolating effect these efforts must have had in wartime Shandong, or
during the civil war after Japanese surrender, when these techniques
continued to be used. Communist forces could move relatively freely and
very often had their opponents completely surrounded. As the then young
Japanese soldier Kuwajima Setsurō, stationed in western Jiaodong,
admitted in his memoir, whatever claims there were on the military maps
in Shandong, the areas under effective occupation by Japan and its
allies in reality consisted only of each county seat and the next
largest village. “Almost everything else was under Eighth Route Army
control.”[^^[730]^^](#_ftn730) When the voices calling for surrender or
threatening retribution continued through the night on all sides of a
fortification, it is not surprising the impact on morale was
considerable.

*The Registry of Good and Evil*

Enemy Work units targeting puppet armies showed great aptitude in
combining the weapons of fear and shame. They also understood that one
did not necessarily need to win over a treasonous soldier in a single
eloquent appeal through a megaphone. Instead, indirect pressure built
over time could eventually wear down an opponent. Nowhere is this better
seen in the use of a “black and red point” (黑紅點) system to track the
behavior of puppet soldiers. This practice, which was also referred to
as the “Registry of Good and Evil” (善惡錄) or the “Book of Life and
Death” (生死簿) contained a separate score sheet for each known puppet
soldier.[^^[731]^^](#_ftn731) In the Luzhong district, Wang Fang
implemented the black and red point system for soldiers under Wu
Huawen’s command.[^^[732]^^](#_ftn732) Whenever a soldier was guilty of
an atrocity, an act of pillage, or some other act detrimental to the
cause of resistance, they would earn a black point. When they performed
an act that aided the resistance, or demonstrated a virtuous character,
they were to be awarded a red point. Until they defected to Communist
control or the Japanese surrendered, military collaborators and enemy
agents could earn a deficit of evil deeds large enough to earn them a
death sentence, despite Mao’s directive that puppet soldiers were to be
shown mercy regardless of their circumstances. When an enemy agent was
executed, the announcement of the death was to be accompanied by a list
of acts associated with their black point score, while any red points
were to remain a secret.[^^[733]^^](#_ftn733)

Besides determining guilt for a future trial—though I have found no
reference in postwar trial descriptions that mention the score, the
point system could only have a deterrent effect if the score could reach
the puppet soldier it tracked. One way this was accomplished was by
announcing the black and red point scores directly to the puppets during
the nightly megaphone announcements. A more indirect but perhaps more
effective way was to pass on updates to the score card not to the
soldier, but to his family.

This indirect communication and pressure was achieved through the
registration of puppet family members (偽屬登記). By 1944, Binhai
military district reported the registration of 1,358 households with
relatives in the puppet armies. In Luzhong, 1,295 households were
registered and in Jiaodong, 1,895.[^^[734]^^](#_ftn734) Registration,
which was updated annually, was only the first step. Assemblies of
puppet families were called to discuss the impact on the resistance of
treasonous military collaboration and, more specifically, the behavior
of local puppet soldiers with relatives at the assembly. 120 such
meetings were held in Luzhong with over 700 participants. Enemy Work
cadres were instructed that the black point crimes of puppet soldier
relatives should be read out at the meetings without insult and in a
matter-of-fact way. The names of those who committed the acts were not
be read out in public. Instead, the families of the puppet soldiers were
to be warned privately of the sins of each relative, such that they
could bear their family shame in silence and apply pressure on their
relatives to return home. Those that did return home were then asked to
participate in the rallies and speak to the hardships they suffered as
collaborators of the Japanese.[^^[735]^^](#_ftn735)

*Zhu De and The Prices of Betrayal*

Attempts to secure the defection of Chinese soldiers fighting alongside
the Japanese by means of propaganda and by approaching family members in
the villages required considerable time, manpower, and a patient process
of wearing down the enemy. Establishing contacts directly with soldiers
or junior officers and either appealing to their patriotic virtues or
offering promises of protection against any future punishment was direct
but dangerous. Perhaps the simplest method to turn the puppet soldiers
away from their treasonous ways was to appeal to the same motivation
which led many of them to fight for the Japanese in the first place:
cold hard cash.

An example of the scale contemplated by Communist plans to supplement
its political efforts with the outright purchase of puppet loyalty is
found in a January 23, 1945 letter from Commander Zhu De to the U.S.
head of the China Theater, General Albert Wedemeyer. “I have a favor
that I wish to ask you,” he began, and then requested a loan of \$20
million from the U.S. to use for the purpose of bribes for puppet
armies.[^^[736]^^](#_ftn736) The amount would be repaid, “following the
victorious conclusion of the war against Japan.” Given his earlier
career, this pragmatic approach was entirely in keeping with the
character of the pragmatic Communist leader of the wartime 8th Route
Army, though none of Zhu De’s main works on winning over enemies openly
proposed bribes for puppets to switch their loyalty. On the contrary,
Zhu argued that the Eighth Route Army and the

New Fourth Armies had an “inexhaustible supply of manpower” thanks to
its ability to attract voluntary recruits inspired by a desire to resist
Japanese aggression. Instead it was the Nationalists who used “buying,”
coercion, and deceit in its efforts to recruit
soldiers.[^^[737]^^](#_ftn737) In the January, 1945 letter to General
Wedemeyer, however, Zhu suggested that bribery could easily double the
number of defections among Japanese collaborator troops achieved by
political means.

 **Table 7.4: Zhu De’s Statistics on Puppets Won-Over, January,
1945[^**^[738]^**^](#_ftn738)**

The approximately 34,167 puppets won-over up to this point, according to
the letter, comprised around 3.8% of a total estimate of around 900,000
Chinese fighting on behalf of the Japanese. Zhu argued that political
measures alone could probably bring this number up to about 5%. This
percentage could be doubled, he argued optimistically, to 10%, or around
90,000, by using “financial” measures. In what can only be described as
a proposed investment plan, Zhu outlined the accounting for his
estimates. The requested \$20 million was to be divided into five
parts.[^^[739]^^](#_ftn739) \$7.6 million was to go towards
administrative costs and operations, including the cost of intelligence
and liaison work. \$1.4 million was to be paid directly to puppet
officers ranging from squad commanders and up through platoon, company,
battalion, regiment, and even the proposed bribery of ten puppet
division commanders. Some 3,000 squad commanders were to be offered \$30
each, while division commanders were to be offered \$10,000. In addition
to these one-time defection bonuses, this fund was to include
post-defection awards to officers who were brought over by political
measures and “comfort fees.” Third, almost a million dollars was to be
set aside for bounties to puppets for bringing over various weapons
ranging in value from rifles (\$20 each) to artillery (\$1,000), as well
as valuable communications equipment. Radio sets, for example, were to
be purchased at \$200 a piece. Fourth, almost five million dollars was
put aside to pay puppets their original salaries for three months, for a
supply of clothing and equipment, a fund for gifts, and subsidies for
the families of the defected puppets. Finally, a reserve fund of five
million was to be put towards using military collaborators for sabotage
and demolition operations as well as special missions to assassinate
Japanese officers.

It is possible that the letter merely represents one very elaborate
attempt by Communists to secure large scale funding from the U.S. in a
slightly more indirect manner, and that the funds were never intended to
go fully towards bribing military collaborators. Zhu De’s request came
at a time when the newly arrived commander of U.S. forces in China was
actively considering the possibility of arming and otherwise supporting
Communist efforts in the war of resistance against
Japan.[^^[740]^^](#_ftn740) In the aftermath of the replacement of the
controversial general Joseph Stilwell in late October, 1944, Zhu was
taking advantage of a brief opportunity to establish an entirely new
relationship with American forces.[^^[741]^^](#_ftn741) In the months
that followed there were a number of proposals and counter-proposals
exchanged on cooperation between Nationalists and Communists, with
General Patrick Hurley serving as intermediary. The process was
complicated by other negotiations, unknown to Wedemeyer and Hurley at
the time, between another U.S. General Robert McClure and the Communists
that culminated in an offer to send thousands of American airborne
troops to be stationed in Communist controlled territory. The final
result of the complicated process was a warning by General Hurley to
President Roosevelt that the offer of close military cooperation with
the Communists was a dangerous development that threatened the
preservation of the Nationalist regime. On 27 January, Chief of Staff
George Marshall ordered that no negotiations were to continue that did
not also involve Chiang Kai-shek’s government. Three days later General
Wedemeyer issued an order to all officers in the China theater directing
them refrain from “discussing hypothetical aid or employment of U.S.
Resources to assist any effort of an unapproved political party,
activity, or persons.”[^^[742]^^](#_ftn742)

*The Wartime Gains of the Bureau*

The cumulative efforts of the enemy and puppet work of the Communist
party in Shandong were considerable, but fell far short of the ambitions
of the party. An early 1945 estimate of the total number of puppet
soldiers that had been won over in Shandong, based on incomplete
statistics, was around 12,000.[^^[743]^^](#_ftn743) This was despite the
fact that in only the year preceding the report, some 45,000 captured
puppet soldiers had been offered the opportunity while under detention.
Some of these, it was claimed, had already been captured and released
six or seven times, by which time even the rebellious Meng Huo of
ancient times had mended his ways.

About half of those who were won over came from relatively small groups.
These defections, often in the dozens or a few hundred, were frequently
announced alongside those from other base areas around northern China in
the Party’s Shandong mouthpiece, *Dazhong
Ribao*(大眾日報).[^^[744]^^](#_ftn744) Some 140 puppet army units with
under 1,000 soldiers each had been won over with a total of around 6,000
rifles. Three units with more than 1,500 soldiers each, including some
6,500 rifles came over. These were the forces of the three major
commanders to defect to Communist control in Shandong during the
Japanese occupation: Wang Dao, Mo Zhengmin, and Zhang
Xixian.[^^[745]^^](#_ftn745) The significant numbers these three
defections alone brought over amply explains why, during the war,
reports on the work of the Enemy and Puppet Bureau repeatedly lamented
its failures to win over larger units. By July, 1945, the number won
over had increased to 150 of the smaller units, but only one additional
large unit had come over to the Communist with the defection of 1,800
soldiers under Han Shouchen in June, 1945. Despite this very late change
of loyalty, Han remained in command of his forces. After the capture of
Hangzhou in 1949, the former puppet army commander became the head the
city’s labor reform camp that would soon fill up with
counterrevolutionaries who might have marveled at Han’s impressive
ability to avoid the fate of its inmates.[^^[746]^^](#_ftn746)

If the total number of those puppet soldiers won over was indeed around
12,000, this is below the number of puppet soldiers who were claimed as
kills up to 1941, let alone the likely far increased kills of later
years, when the 115th division and local resistance forces grew more
confident and moved to the offensive. Though they are even more likely
to be susceptible to wild exaggeration, the cumulative reports of
claimed puppet army kills in a selection of wartime chronologies of
Shandong regional gazetteers are vastly higher, especially from local
skirmishes listed for the summer of 1945 when Communist forces
throughout Shandong aggressively attacked strongholds and towns occupied
by puppet armies.[^^[747]^^](#_ftn747)

It is likely that most of the remaining puppet soldiers, including those
listed in Appendix C, were in part or whole integrated or reorganized as
units in the Nationalist army. Some of these, as we saw in the case of
Wu Huawen, would later turn to the Communists when the nationalist cause
in Shandong was truly deemed lost by mid-1948. For the most part,
however, when Nationalist forces returned to the province in 1945,
beginning with the entry into the province of its new governor He
Siyuan, they resumed control of only the small number of towns and
strongholds that were still under Japanese and puppet army control.
Puppet soldiers as well as Japanese soldiers were instructed to
“maintain public order” until the central government could
re-established control.

![](diss_files/image004.png)

**Figure 2: The American marines are welcomed to Qingdao in October,
1945.** Above the cannons the text reads, “The merging of Japanese,
puppets, and Chiang [Kai-shek’s] forces.”[^^[748]^^](#_ftn748) \
 \

Most Japanese soldiers were eventually disarmed and returned home,
though some retained their arms to patrol the streets for months in
major Chinese cities and in places such as Shanxi, continued to actively
fight in the civil war. Communist propaganda of a “conspiracy” by Chiang
Kai-shek to “merge” with the enemy and the puppets was not that far from
the truth. The majority of former puppet soldiers in Shandong who were
still operating as of August, 1945 would soon have the option of
continuing to serve in the Nationalist army. If this was a conspiracy,
however, it was one in which the Communists participated. If most puppet
armies served the Nationalists after the war, it was not because
Communists refused to absorb the forces of the occupation. During the
crucial period of transition, however, the wartime gains by the Enemy
and Puppet work bureau would come under threat.

*Divided Responsibilities*

The key innovation of the Communist Party in dealing with military
collaboration with Japan was that, up until Japanese surrender, its
general policy was to isolate them from its mass campaigns and treat
puppet soldiers as *neither* traitors nor as war criminal suspects, even
if it portrayed them as such. In propaganda, in Party sponsored
publications, and in postwar literature their violence and national
betrayal was a regular topic of discussion. Threats made to puppet
soldiers who the CCP tried to win over, and the red and black point
system also, of course, primarily focused on the seriousness of the
crimes they were guilty of. However, the Enemy and Puppet Work Bureau
judged its success by the metric of loyalties won, not by criminals
punished. Every puppet soldier executed for crimes committed against
civilians or resistance forces could potentially frighten away an entire
unit of his fellow soldiers. Until a new regime under the leadership of
the Communist Party was strong and stable, those lost rifles and the
lost fighting ability would not only denied the Party but serve the
Japanese or the Nationalist central government that sought its
destruction. We already saw this threat become a reality in Laiwu when
the Party alienated the followers of the Middle Way society and even
more following its attack on the leadership of the Hard Fist Society.

In order to keep enemy and puppet work separate from the process of
apprehending and punishing traitors and collaborators in general, the
work of the bureau was kept explicitly distinct from the “traitor
elimination work” (鋤奸工作) carried out by the Social Affairs Bureau
and later the Public Security Bureau. A Shandong Party Sub-Bureau
directive clarifying the relationship between enemy and puppet work and
traitor elimination work ordered that, “No targeted individual may be
handled by both.”[^^[749]^^](#_ftn749) Its instructions on how to
determine who should assume responsibility were not terribly helpful.
Those who were to be won over, it explained, were to be handled by the
enemy and puppet work groups, while traitors were to be handled by the
traitor elimination cadres. Puppet soldiers generally but not always
fell into the former category, something that is mostly confirmed by
traitor elimination work reports up to 1945. For example, internal
statistics on traitor elimination and police work in the Bohai district
for 1944 lists 2,529 arrests in thirteen categories of crimes. Of these,
466 were executed. While there were many categories of treasonous
behavior and other crimes listed, none of these listing puppet armies.
As we shall see, this changed after Japanese surrender. The two largest
groups executed were 181 enemy spies (敵探) and 103 bandits or thieves
(盜匪).[^^[750]^^](#_ftn750) The same report mentions elsewhere,
however, that almost a hundred puppet soldiers had been won over in a
discussion of its work with apprehended enemy agents, suggesting at
least some flexibility in the divisions of labor. Another 1944 list of
punishments meted out in almost 200 cases of treason elimination work in
the Jiaodong area included one puppet police officer, who was released,
but no other puppet soldiers.[^^[751]^^](#_ftn751) Puppet soldiers do
appear occasionally in traitor elimination statistics from earlier
years, but they were very small in number.

Japanese surrender would bring a number of changes to this arrangement.
As we saw earlier, on 14 August the Sub-bureau threatened liquidation to
any puppets who did not immediately surrender. On 20 August, new
“Shandong Military District Regulations for Handling Puppet Soldiers and
Puppet Police” were issued.

​1) For those that secretly helped the resistance or surrendered before
Japan did so, the regulations confirmed the “three guarantees” that had
been offered: not to be disarmed, not to be disbanded, and to be allowed
to continue fighting.

​2) Even those who had “caused relatively large damage to the resistance
efforts but who gave in before Japanese surrender” were to be treated
leniently.

​3) Those who were under attack by Communist forces and finally gave in
under direct military pressure were to have their units reorganized but
given preferential treatment.

​4) Those who gave up when Japan surrendered were to be given treatment
according to the regulations for prisoners of war.[^^[752]^^](#_ftn752)

​5) Those who refused to surrender were to be liquidated and considered
guilty as traitors.[^^[753]^^](#_ftn753)

Soon enough, however, article five would lose some of its bite, and the
work of combining threats with enticements was to resume. A 25 September
directive ordered that the work of the enemy and puppet bureau was to
continue but its form and approach would change.[^^[754]^^](#_ftn754)
Instead of focusing on the upper ranks of puppet soldiers in order to
secure large-scale defections, the emphasis was to shift to primarily
convert the lower ranks. Also, because the territory under Communist
Party control had vastly expanded, cadres were to widen their efforts to
register the family members of former puppet
soldiers.[^^[755]^^](#_ftn755)

From this point on the term “puppet soldiers” became a more ambiguous
term. It could refer to those who had previously fought for the
Japanese, but increasingly, it could refer to anyone who fought in the
central government’s army. During the war, military collaborators with
Japan and Nationalist forces were distinguished. The latter called
either the “allied army” (友軍) when the Party wished to emphasize the
united front but they were more often referred to as the “stubborn
army”   (頑軍) when relations were hostile. After the war, Nationalist
troops who had never fought for the Japanese might find themselves
referred to as puppet armies to rob the central government of its claim
to legitimacy.

As a result, there emerged a very unfortunate group of former military
collaborators caught between two Communist policies. Those who
surrendered in time could retain their weapons, unit integrity and
sometimes even their commanders. This was true at least as late as June,
1945, when Han Shouchen surrendered and given command of a newly
reorganized Fourth Independent Brigade in the army of resistance. These
forces had picked the right side at a moment when a new stage in the
Chinese civil war was about to begin and they could potentially avoid
punishment for wartime crimes completely—or at least until future
political campaigns in the 1950s and 1960s dug up their past sins once
again. On the other hand, those who remained safely in Jinan, Qingdao,
or a handful of strongholds in the otherwise Communist landscape of
Shandong stood a reasonable chance—but as we shall see by no means a
guarantee—of continued employment under a Nationalist regime desperate
to reestablish its hold on the province. They could then defect to the
Communist enemy work bureau when the opportunity presented itself and
continue to serve as newly minted revolutionary soldiers.

The puppet soldiers who found themselves faced with the real prospect of
punishment, now at the hands of “traitor elimination” cadres were
primarily: 1) those already in Communist custody who had been captured
as result of an attack and had not yet been released according to the
“seven captures of Meng Huo” policy that was active up to the time of
Japanese surrender, 2) those puppet soldiers who surrendered to
Communist forces in or shortly after August, 1945. After Japanese
surrender, these unlucky puppet prisoners of war would find themselves
merged together with the ranks of other “puppet government employees”
and enemy agents who were the primary targets of the traitor elimination
cadres.

*Magnanimity, Repentance, and Reform*

The world that puppet soldiers in custody around the time of surrender
found themselves in was very different from the one they faced during
the war. By the time of Japanese surrender, the work of traitor
elimination cadres had gradually moved away from its roots in the
liquidation business. During the period of Communist control in the
Jiangxi Soviet period, and in Shandong during the early years of the
resistance, traitor elimination work lived up to its name most fully, as
its work often consisted of the arrest, trial, and execution of those
deemed traitors. Though these were often referred to with the common
word for traitor *hanjian* or, one who has betrayed the Han people, the
term most directly referred to the betrayal of the Party and only
indirectly the Chinese nation as a whole. Those accused were most often
Party cadres accused of Trotskyist or other heterodoxy. They were
overwhelmingly “internal traitors” (內奸), such as the victims of the
“Huxi incident” who were accused of secretly plotting the destruction of
the Party and working in league with international fascism. Following
the mass witch-hunt of Trotskyists in the Huxi Incident of 1939, along
with several similar incidents, the Shandong Sub-bureau began to slowly
deemphasize the threat of Trotskyists in its internal directives to
traitor elimination cadres, call for greater attention to the threat of
Japanese and Nationalist spies and, most importantly, reform the
procedures for the punishment of accused traitors.[^^[756]^^](#_ftn756)
Increasingly, treason elimination work was to be carried out through the
masses in the form of struggle sessions and mass trials.

While treason elimination cadres had to take responsibility for ensuring
that liberated zones remained free of enemy spies, the Party purged of
its crticis, and uncooperative collaborators in nearby communities kept
continuously under threat of liquidation, there was ever greater
emphasis on using their work as another way to mobilize or awaken the
masses. While enemy and puppet work teams stayed focused on winning over
their enemy, treason elimination committees paid much closer attention
to the number of passive peasants who were transformed into political
subjects by a process of mobilization (發動 or 震動起來) than to the
number and fate of traitors they apprehended. The reaction of the masses
to any given sentencing and their numbers of attendance at mass
assemblies were the subjects of extensive comment in treason elimination
reports, while the facts of a case or the justice of any ruling were
only important when some grave injustice had caused widespread
discontent with the Party.

Prisoners were subject to a new set of regulations which merged the
crimes of treason with those of war crimes, the “Provisional Regulations
for the Punishment of War Criminals and Traitors in Shandong
Province.”[^^[757]^^](#_ftn757) It called for a sentence of death or 10
or more years of imprisonment for a wide range of crimes including:

​1) Those who from start to finish showed loyalty to Japanese
imperialism, were guilty of great crimes and had caused suffering for
the people.

​2) Those who were leading officers or conspirators who served in the
Japanese military, intelligence organs, liaisons, or military police.

​3) Those who, after Japan declared surrender, refused to surrender, and
continued to resist, or killed the people.

​4) In the confusion of war caused disorder.

​5) Those who were leading officers and conspirators among the puppet
military and police, were puppet officials, or who actively destroyed
the efforts towards national liberation.

​6) Those who killed or abused prisoners

​7) Those leading conspirators who, through feudal societies and
superstitious organizations served the enemy and actively destroyed the
efforts towards national liberation

​8) Those who massacred the people.

​9) Those who arranged for betrayal and surrender to the enemy or who
themselves treasonously surrendered to the enemy and actively destroyed
efforts towards national liberation.

…

And so the list went on. Unlike the Nationalist regime’s own law for the
punishment of traitors published in draft form later that winter, these
regulations contained no mitigating clauses.[^^[758]^^](#_ftn758) They
were flexible enough in their definition that they could ensnare almost
any military collaborator and sentence them to the ultimate punishment.
After all, what puppet soldiers had not “treasonously surrendered to the
enemy,” or at least “caused disorder” doing the war? Instead of
mitigating clauses for those who had somehow helped the resistance or
helped the people, only the magnanimity of the Party allowed traitors a
chance to reform themselves, be forgiven, and welcomed back into the
community. This “magnanimous policy” (寬大政策) was to serve as a
general guide in all treatment of collaborators but, on the ground,
puppet soldier prisoners would face two potential processes of
retribution and reform: one administered directly by treason elimination
cadres of the Public Security bureau, and the other incorporated
directly into the mass campaigns in the local community, in which
treason elimination cadres played a more indirect role more akin to
theatrical directors.

In the early months after surrender, puppet soldiers found themselves
for the first time subject to a joint process of retribution together
with other accused traitors. They were required to complete a program of
re-education in a special “training unit” (偽組織人員訓練班) which
included a process of supplying written confessions and open expressions
of repentance (悔過). In Weihaiwei, on the northeastern coast of the
Jiaodong peninsula, these training units were assembled October 2nd,
1945.[^^[759]^^](#_ftn759) The course they were offered was carried out
in two cycles to accommodate the large numbers of puppet employees, and
were divided into two stages. The first stage consisted of a period of
educational lectures on the nature of the new democratic government,
lectures on the Party policy towards land reform, on the resilience of
the Eight Route Army, on their accomplishments during the war of
resistance, on the Party’s policy of leniency, and then a selection of
public confessional speeches by former leading collaborationist
officials. Two hours of classes were offered in the morning, followed by
one hour of discussion and each day concluded with two hours of informal
discussion (座談) in the evenings. The second stage of the course was
conducted in small groups, during which time course participants were
expected to produce detailed self-criticisms of their past
behavior.[^^[760]^^](#_ftn760) In order to promote sufficiently
repentant behavior, in each group activists (積極份子) were cultivated
who would urge the others on. Those who showed remorse passed the
course, and would be conditionally released. Particularly stubborn or
uncooperative course participants were forced to enroll in an additional
short training course.

The first two cycles yielded 178 “graduates,” including 60 “puppet”
village mayors, 71 officers of various ranks in neighborhood
associations, 13 “puppet” secretaries, as well as a number of commerce
chamber members, and city district chiefs. Most of the trainees were
from poor backgrounds: 103 were poor farmers, 14 were registered as
merchants, and only one a landlord. By the end of the total four months
of training courses provided, two hundred more collaborators had
completed the training course, and its targets had significantly
expanded, including police chiefs, security guards, bandits, spies,
“puppet” laborers, “puppet” teachers and students, puppet village level
officials, and puppet soldiers.[^^[761]^^](#_ftn761)

In Bohai district, a more scaled-down and decentralized process was
adopted for an estimated 40,000 puppet soldier prisoners and other
collaborators. Those in towns were processed directly by Public Security
bureau cadres who manned special “Offices for Repentance” (悔過處),
while in the country county government officials handled their
cases.[^^[762]^^](#_ftn762) Accused puppet soldiers were collectively
registered and organized into training units with 70-80 puppet troops
each. These units were given a mere two days of intense re-education
that was to emphasize the forgiving nature of the Party’s magnanimous
policy, the severity of their past crimes, and carry out group exercise
of self-reflection and confession.[^^[763]^^](#_ftn763)

Not all areas of Shandong had such organized re-education programs for
puppet soldiers and other collaborators. In some, areas the processing
of puppet soldier prisoners consisted of a more simple process of
organizing a single mass rally, and have the assembled puppet prisoners
collectively express remorse for their crimes. The sheer numbers
involved sometimes made it impossible to do more. For example, in
Yongzhi county which had a total population of 180,000 in 1946, there
were no less than 10,000 puppet soldiers, most of whom were poor farmers
from the area.[^^[764]^^](#_ftn764) After asking them to confess their
crimes and write letters of self-examination (反省), they were allowed
to regain their political rights.[^^[765]^^](#_ftn765)

*The Eight Great Disorders and the Oppose Treason Campaign*

“What have the violations of our policies been like over the past year?
Those of disorder…the eight great disorders of *luan*(wanton, chaotic
and indiscriminate) beatings, *luan* arrests, *luan* killing, *luan*
punishment, *luan* imprisonment, *luan* torture, *luan* confiscations,
and *luan* sealing off of buildings. One can say this explains the
*luan* state of our policies.” Public Security Bureau Report, Bohai
District, 1946[^^[766]^^](#_ftn766)\
 \

The formal and almost bureaucratic process of purging guilt through
repentance and re-education overlapped with a simultaneous process of
mass trials for traitors. As Communist control was consolidated over
dozens of towns, counties, and even a few cities that had been under
some form of occupation by Japanese or puppet military troops, its new
administrators subjected their inhabitants almost immediately to two
increasingly linked campaigns, the “Rent and Interest Reduction”
(減租減息) campaign and the “Oppose Treason and Voice Grievances”
(反奸訴苦) campaign.[^^[767]^^](#_ftn767) This second campaign was also
called the movement to “Settle Accounts with Traitors” (漢奸清算). In
the vast territories of Shandong liberated during the aggressive push of
Communist forces in the last months of the war, the Oppose Treason
campaign was both the main vehicle for retribution against both wartime
collaborators and a preliminary blow against local elites that would
soon become the main target of the massive land reform efforts that
would follow.

Though it was carried out on a rolling basis as areas were liberated,
the peak of the campaign in the Shandong base area was in the first half
of 1946. It combined the public airing of grievances against
collaborators with mass trials of selected suspects. Each town and
village was to collectively request the purging of their community. The
Shandong provincial archives holds a number of petitions of this kind,
all dated February or March of 1946, calling for the new democratic
government to punish collaborators. They are often signed by a list of
family or clan representatives with an indication of the number of its
members. While each of them have some variation in the list of their
demands, most include the request that the new Shandong government under
the Communist party carry out the, “disbandment of the puppet armies and
strict punishment of traitors” Each petition then usually lists some of
the local collaborators and their crimes, and sometimes includes and
account of the deaths and possessions pillaged in attacks by a
particular puppet army unit.[^^[768]^^](#_ftn768)

For many communities in Shandong, the Oppose Treason movement and the
Rent and Interest reduction movements were the first taste of the large
scale mass political campaigns to be felt throughout China in the
decades to come. The Oppose Treason campaign does not appear to have
focused on puppet army officers and soldiers but for the first time
puppet soldiers begin to appear consistently as a category in lists of
cases and sentencing reports of treason elimination cadres summarizing
their progress. At least some of these puppet soldiers subjected to mass
trial were prisoners that had completed the process of registration and
repentance but were found to have been guilty of particularly heinous
crimes. In the eyes of the local population as well as the local cadres
who lived and worked among them, the transfer of puppet soldiers and
other collaborationist employees from the repentance and training
process to public trials did not happen enough. Acknowledging a growing
criticism of its policy of leniency, in the case of puppet soldiers in
particular the Public Security Bureau blamed its failures on the
difficulty in sharing information about alleged crimes from one county
to the next.[^^[769]^^](#_ftn769)

As a 1945 report on traitor elimination work in Kunlun county put it,
“there is criticism of our paralysis. We think if the [puppet soldiers]
confess we should be lenient and after show our magnanimity there is no
need to continue to collect material [for their
cases].”[^^[770]^^](#_ftn770) The problem was also, however, that the
reform and repentance process usually included at least one large rally
where puppet soldiers and collaborators made their remorse public. In
Zhaobei county, this was accomplished over the course of two days in
rallies attended by 9,600 men, women, and children. Evaluating their
response, the county administration noted that most people felt the
government was showing its desire to follow the will of the people, but
noted that other criticized it saying, “Today, were they suddenly reborn
when they confessed their crime? That is just too
easy.”[^^[771]^^](#_ftn771) Both administrators and the local populace
began to take things into their own hands and the Shandong Party
Sub-bureau found it impossible to control the retributive violence it
had sought to channel into political mobilization. Reports came in of
local militias refusing to hand over their prisoners, or of executing
them rather than risk Party “magnanimity.”

Party officials were also eagerly joining in. In Bohai, for example,
“the cadres are enthusiastic, but they usually believe that all the
world under Heaven is ours. They lack political consciousness in the
dealing with puppet police, traitors, and so on and simply view their
task as one of revenge.”[^^[772]^^](#_ftn772) Throughout the newly
liberated districts, Party cadres were engaged in “wanton arrests and
killing”  (亂捕亂殺), wanton beating, and the torturing of prisoners.
“The beatings and arrests have become as regular as one’s daily meal.
Where the campaigns are being carried out, every village has its own
jail and its own militia.”[^^[773]^^](#_ftn773) Most of the violence,
however, seemed to be at the hands of local militias  (民兵) and those
who attended the rallies organized in the Oppose Treason rallies. In one
county carrying out the Oppose Treason campaign, it was reported that 40
treason suspects had been beaten to death by locals, 24 in a second, 8
in the county of Putai, and 20 accused “war criminals” (戰犯) stoned to
death in the county of Gaoyuan.[^^[774]^^](#_ftn774)

Retributive violence against collaborators, or at least carried out in
the name of vengeance against collaboration, is found in formerly
occupied territories throughout the world in 1945, and the violent
repression carried out by the occupier and puppet armies in Shandong
gave its population more than enough reason to demand punishment. Beyond
this, at least two factors contributed to the scale of retributive
violence in Shandong. The first was the mass character of campaigns
themselves. Treason elimination cadres, especially those in Shandong,
were on notice for their excesses in earlier years, whether this was
mass executions like those carried out at Huxi, a tendency to pursue
vendettas and the “subjective” punishments of traitors, or for causing
general fear among the peasants when secretly arresting and executing
suspects (密捕密決) in the dead of night.[^^[775]^^](#_ftn775) The mass
trial approach that was developed in the last years of the war tried to
combine meticulous stage management of trials with an effort to carry
out of the will of the people and thereby win their support. Activists
were planted, suspects chosen, evidence carefully prepared, but
disappointment expressed at the outcome in some internal reports suggest
that the outcome of trials was at lease sometimes genuinely left up to
the people, with calls for execution subject to confirmation from the
district leadership. It was essential to create the impression that the
people were sovereign, while the Party merely carried out its wishes.
When it was reported that the people did not feel their will was carried
out in treason trials, this was blamed on insufficient preparation by
traitor elimination cadres.[^^[776]^^](#_ftn776) This process of managed
empowerment of the people lay at the heart of the Party’s ability to
rapidly gain trust in areas it captured, but was a double-edged sword.
The time and manpower required to prepare and direct these trials might
have been manageable in wartime years, but in 1945 and 1946, cadres were
completely overwhelmed. Their control over the trial process
deteriorated as a result.

The second significant factor contributing to the scale of violence in
Shandong was the huge growth in people’s militias. These forces, often
armed to some degree, played an important role in rapidly expanding a
nominal Party presence in areas beyond the wartime base area as the war
drew to an end, but they lacked discipline and often ignored directives,
especially where Party authority was still weak. The militias of towns
began to fight with each other, with militias of one village threatening
to arrest the collaborators of neighboring
communities.[^^[777]^^](#_ftn777) In a reference to the brutal
counter-insurgency raids of the Japanese, it was reported in one
district that the local militias had been, “carrying out a mopping-up
campaign for three months.”[^^[778]^^](#_ftn778)

Not surprisingly, word of the uncontrolled violence against puppet
soldier prisoners and collaborators alike was beginning to reach the
puppet troops that had not yet surrendered. Word of their responses, in
turn, made their way back to the Party. “If you are going to surrender,
do it directly to the government. If the people’s militia catch you,
they will stone you to within an inch of your life,” one was reported
saying. Another pointed out the risks of magnanimity being combined with
mass rallies where their victims could call for their death, “The
government is magnanimous, but if the people in the village aren’t
magnanimous, it does you no good.” And again, “There is lenient, and
then there is lenient. If they ‘struggle’ the life out of you, what good
does it do you?”[^^[779]^^](#_ftn779)

This was precisely the kind of distrust that jeopardized the continuing
work of the enemy and puppet cadres after Japanese surrender. It could
even threaten the base area’s control over whole communities as another
report from Jiaodong pointed out. “You must be careful in carrying out
the Oppose Traitors campaign. In some villages there were a relatively
large number of surrendered puppet soldiers and their families. If they
come under attack [by the movement], they will resist us and come under
the influence of bad elements.”[^^[780]^^](#_ftn780) Most of all,
however, it meant more men under arms serving the armies of the
Nationalist government. An intelligence report on the state of puppet
troops in Luzhong from the summer of 1946 saw this as translating
directly into a military threat. There an estimated 50,000 puppet
soldiers had joined 38,700 Nationalist forces entering into Shandong
after Japanese surrender. The report lamented that these Luzhong puppet
soldiers had not been won over and that they had failed to appreciate
the Party’s policy of leniency.[^^[781]^^](#_ftn781) The reason for this
was not hard to grasp, as the report admitted. The soldiers were
terrified of the Party’s mass movements, saying, “Even if the Eighth
Route Army forgives me, the people cannot.”

*Conclusion***

There was a girl whose father was executed by shooting. She cried
continuously as she faced the war criminal and accused him of the crime.
Then she climbed up onto the stage and beat him to death with a stone.

*Reaction:* The masses were moved and began to cry.

-Example case from the “Oppose Treason and Voice Grievances” campaign in
Rizhao county, Public Security Bureau Report, 1946.[^^[782]^^](#_ftn782)

The Communist Party in Shandong province understood just as well as the
Nationalist regime that the tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers who
helped maintain the Japanese occupation in the peninsula were as
valuable for their manpower and their rifles as they were reviled for
their treason and their violence. This value did not diminish with
Japanese surrender and the approach of a devastating civil war. The
Party’s wartime efforts to win over military collaborators, shield them
from retribution, and redeploy them were renewed in the postwar period,
but as we saw, this was punctuated by a short period in which tens of
thousands of Chinese treated as prisoners of war found themselves caught
up in twin processes of reform and retribution in the fall of 1945 and
spring of 1946. Here too the Party pressed hard to limit the scope and
severity of retribution through its policy of magnanimity, but found
this impossible to achieve.

If puppet soldiers feared retribution in the mass trials carried out
throughout Shandong in 1945 and 1946, their alternative was to be a part
of Chiang Kai-shek’s “conspiracy” to merge his troops with the puppets.
Just as the major puppet army commanders who were won over to Communist
control in Shandong, including Mo Zhengmin, Zhang Xixian, Han Shouchen
and later Wu Huawen, retained command of their forces and went on to
successful postwar careers in the People’s Republic, many puppet
commanders in the province were able to rejoin the Nationalist army, and
some estimated 100,000 puppet soldiers joined them.[^^[783]^^](#_ftn783)
These include Zhang Tianzuo, Ning Chunling, Wang Jimei, and Wang
Jinyang. Some, such as Cao Keming survived the civil war in Shandong and
joined the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan.

The fate of puppet commanders who stayed in the few Nationalist
controlled areas was not guaranteed, however. Two of the most important
wartime puppet army generals, Zhang Buyun and the former Japanese
citizen Zhang Zongyuan were both executed after being tried by the
courts of the Nationalist administration. Zhang, tried for “pillage,
murder, and treason,” was executed in Qingdao, January
1948.[^^[784]^^](#_ftn784)

Zhang Zongyuan’s origins made his case more complicated. Even though the
Nationalist government’s law for the punishment of treason did not
stipulate that those charged have Chinese citizenship and, in fact,
tried number of foreigners for the crime, Japanese prisoners of war were
to come under the laws for prosecution as war
criminals.[^^[785]^^](#_ftn785) Though born in Japan, Zhang Zongyuan
claimed ties to a Chinese ancestor that had joined the crew of a
Japanese pirate ship during the Ming dynasty.[^^[786]^^](#_ftn786)
Zhang’s convoluted case resembled the challenge faced by the Nationalist
government in prosecuting the last Chinese and later Manchurian emperor
Puyi’s cousin Kawashima Yoshiko, as well as a small number of accused
Taiwanese traitors who could claim they were Japanese citizens during
the time they committed their alleged treason.[^^[787]^^](#_ftn787) Like
Kawashima Yoshiko, who at various times described herself as Chinese,
Manchurian or Japanese, after his arrest Zhang Zongyuan could not seem
to make up his mind whether he wanted to be treated as Chinese or as
Japanese. A military investigation looking into the problem was equally
confused and ruled he had two native places. It claimed this merely made
the severity of his crime, which was to include “war crimes and
treason”   (戰犯漢奸) among others, all the more
serious.[^^[788]^^](#_ftn788) He was executed in Shanghai, in June,
1948.

On the Communist side, those puppet soldiers who were subjected to mass
trials in the Oppose Treason campaign of 1945 and 1946 were sentenced in
a legal process which was not terribly concerned with which particular
crime its convictions were filed under, even if its campaign was
ostensibly organized to target those guilty of collaboration. On the
contrary, from the Party’s perspective, the key was to tie this process
to its preparations for full scale land reform by linking it with the
Rent and Interest Reduction campaign. It was to accomplish this, as a
report from northern Binhai explained because, “The Oppose Treason
campaign is a movement with two sides. One is the national struggle
(民族鬥爭). It is a struggle of all the classes against the small time
traitors. Secondly it is a class struggle, a way to attack landlords who
maintained their wealth through their treasonous
acts.”[^^[789]^^](#_ftn789) Of these, the second was by far the most
important. Puppet soldiers were thus largely peripheral to this process,
all the more so because they often came from relatively humble origins
and were needed in the fight against the Nationalists.

From the perspective of the population, however, the military
collaborators who were briefly subjected to mass justice were as reviled
as the Japanese occupier. Indeed, for those who lived in areas without
regular Japanese patrols, these Chinese military collaborators were the
*only* face of the long occupation. Having stood by during the war while
dozens of small groups of military collaborators transformed overnight
by the Enemy and Puppet Work teams into units of the army of resistance,
it is not terribly surprising that many had little patience for the
Party’s “policy of magnanimity” when their opportunity finally came for
retribution.

**Epilogue: The Rise of Transitional Justice and the Long Decline of
Treason**

In the opening chapter of this dissertation I argued that trials for
wartime atrocities under the laws and courts of treason were not limited
to the countries and former colonies this work has focused upon. They
were common to most of the states affected by the Second World War. Some
of the treasonous war criminals brought to trial were executed or served
prison sentences. Others were caught up in the waves of retributive
violence outside the courtroom. For those who faced trial, why did it
matter what was written on their indictments? Why should victims have
cared if their torturers were tried in a tribunal for treason or one for
war crimes? As long as the perpetrator’s deeds were denounced and their
violence punished, what difference did it make? It is unlikely that the
woman we met in Chapter Seven, who confronted her father’s killer on the
stage and proceeded to beat him to death with a stone, was at all
interested in the fact that the accused had been put before the
villagers as part of a political campaign against traitors, rather than
as a murderer. The young Filipino girl who survived a massacre of
hundreds to testify in court against the accused Makapili member
Florentino Canibas may not even have known the accused stood on trial
for the “complex crime” of treason with murder.

 It may not have made a difference to these particular victims in the
early aftermath of war but each of the chapters of this dissertation has
argued that punishing brutality as betrayal had significant consequences
on both the specific outcomes of the proceedings, and upon the broader
political environment in which they took place. Nowhere was the prospect
of treason trials, of any kind, as flawed an approach as in the late
colonial contexts of India and Burma. In India, the attempt to punish
the “turncoats who happened to be brutes” not only produced a violent
backlash, but further weakened proceedings across Southeast Asia where
there were more appropriate targets for prosecution. In Burma, the
highly politicized process of trying military collaborators was
abandoned entirely. While Japanese war criminals were being tried for
the massacre of Britain’s loyal minority guerrillas, colonial officials
blocked any attempt to try Burmese soldiers who had participated in
similar acts. In the Philippines, I have argued that the very creation
of the category of military collaborators that was excluded from the
amnesty of 1948 was a deeply problematic. Moreover, some of the
characteristics of the treason law itself had a profound impact on the
selection of the accused and the evidence required to secure conviction.

The impact of treating wartime violence as treason did not merely have
an impact on the legal process of retribution. It further facilitated an
alternative approach that emphasized the reformability of the traitor.
Downplaying dark deeds condemned in any other context, unwieldy numbers
of military collaborators were portrayed as mainly guilty of crimes of
the heart or victims of an unfortunate affliction. This made it all the
easier to justify large-scale efforts to transform them into soldiers
that could be redeployed once more in the service of the nation.
Philippine constabulary members could return to the field to fight
against their old wartime Huk enemies, Chinese puppet soldiers could
redeem themselves in the eyes of the revolution, and Indian National
Army soldiers could “take another crack” at the Japanese.

The trials, attempts at trials, or reform of traitors described in the
chapters here were deeply troubled processes that either failed to
justly reckon with wartime atrocities or themselves helped contribute to
the violence and instability in the early postwar period. In these
closing pages I want to suggest that the phenomenon of punishing the
crimes of war under the laws of treason in the aftermath of the Second
World War came at the cusp of a global transition; a transition which
mirrors a related process far better understood: the rise of
transitional justice and international humanitarian law in the twentieth
century.

*Transitional Justice and the Justice Cascade*

The pattern in which wartime atrocities became wrapped in treason or
collaboration trials broke down in the second half of the Twentieth
century. In recent decades a number of important war criminals who were
not of German heritage would face trial only for their crimes against
humanity, and not those against nation. These include the Dutch SS
officer Pieter Menten, the Danish Waffen-SS volunteer Søren Kam, the
Ukrainian death camp guard John Demjanjuk, the Lithuanian guard Vladas
Zajančkauskas, former Croatian minister of interior Andreja Artukoviç,
Croatian commander of the Jasenovac concentration camp Dinko Šakić, and
the Estonian guard in the Tartu concentration camp Karl Linnas. Some of
these were tried in their home countries. France convicted Vichy period
police chief Christian Bousquet, former head of the Lyon militia Paul
Touvier, and Maurice Papon for crimes against humanity beginning in the
1990s.[^^[790]^^](#_ftn790)

Indeed, over the past few decades the spectacle of elderly war
criminals, both German and non-German, being dragged out of quiet
retirement by persistent Nazi hunters, sent across the world, and dying
while awaiting conviction for the murder of thousands has become so
common, it is hard to keep one case distinct from the other. To be sure,
no equivalent exists in Asia either for Japanese war criminals, or those
among its former allies who committed atrocities.[^^[791]^^](#_ftn791)
Nor, should we fail to note, was the absence of the Western Allies
remedied in the process of decolonization in the region. For example,
there has been very little significant momentum for national trials of
Dutch soldiers guilty of atrocities in Indonesia, French and Americans
in Vietnam, or the British torturers of Malaya—either in their home
countries or their former colonies.[^^[792]^^](#_ftn792) Even in these
cases, however, if trials or some other process of reconciliation was
adopted, it would no longer seem at all out of place. This is because of
the monumental rise of transitional justice since the end of the Second
World War.

Transitional justice is a term for a set of retributive and restorative
practices that respond to large-scale atrocities and other human rights
violations. These include trials, lustration, truth commissions,
reparations, memorialization, as well as the reform of security organs
such as the police and military.[^^[793]^^](#_ftn793) Unlike other terms
favored by historians such as “political trials” or “political
retribution,” transitional justice is both a descriptive term that
groups a number of disparate processes together and one which includes a
strong normative component emphasizing the moral goal of rectifying
injustice. As a result, both social scientists and practitioners often
limit the term to cases of states transitioning to democracy, especially
from the 1970s on.[^^[794]^^](#_ftn794) The widespread adoption of this
term is not a trivial discursive shift, but one that was possible thanks
to the series of changes which gave rise to what Kathryn Sikkink and
Ellen Lutz call the “justice cascade.”[^^[795]^^](#_ftn795) These
developments came about in no small part thanks to the selective and
imperfect prosecutions against war crimes after the war. In an essay on
the genealogy of transitional justice and the discourse around it over
the past few decades Ruti G. Teitel divides its development into three
phases, the first of which culminated in the Nuremberg and Tokyo
trials.[^^[796]^^](#_ftn796) Most other works also point to this as a
foundational moment for transitional justice. The trials helped inspire
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Genocide convention, and
influence the 1949 Geneva Convention, but diplomats failed in their
early postwar efforts to create an International Criminal Court. The
lack of a cooperative spirit in the international community as Cold War
loyalties hardened was certainly a key to this failure, but just as
important was the realization of how great the sacrifice of national
sovereignty would be entailed by any permanent
court.[^^[797]^^](#_ftn797)

A second phase in the development of transitional justice is tied to the
wave of transitions beginning in the 1970s and accelerating into the
post-cold war. Transitions in Spain, Portugal and Greece were followed
soon by a wave of regime changes in Latin America. For Teitel, the most
important feature of this period is the way in which tensions between
demands for punishment and amnesty helped generate new ways of
confronting the past beyond the criminal trials of early postwar period.
This created new debates that balanced issues of punishment with
attempts to uncover truth and pursue reconciliation, as well as find a
balance between maintaining peace and achieving
justice.[^^[798]^^](#_ftn798) In Teitel’s final phase, the justice of
transition moves from the periphery to the center. It has entered a
period in which the normalization of transitional justice and the
expansion in the laws of war have given rise to new risks as calls for
humanitarian intervention and defense against terror are subject to ever
greater politicization.

If Teitel is more focused on the development of law and specific
practices as a result of these changes, Sikking’s “justice cascade” is
centered upon the “Shift in the legitimacy of the norm of individual
criminal accountability for human rights violations and an increase in
criminal prosecutions on behalf of that norm.”[^^[799]^^](#_ftn799)
Instead of distinct and somewhat disconnected phases, Sikking sees this
cascade formed by the merger of a “streambed” of international
humanitarian law, a growing number of state prosecutions both
international and national in scope, and finally an increasingly
important role for non-state actors, including Amnesty International and
domestic human rights organizations around the world. Again, the early
postwar trials were a foundational moment, but for Sikking as well as a
number of other scholars, their greatest contribution was that they led
to an, “ ‘individualization’ of international law, because it focused on
the individual—both as the perpetrator of crimes and as a victim who had
standing to bring forward cases against
perpetrators.”[^^[800]^^](#_ftn800)

The fact that individual criminal responsibility of perpetrators for
atrocities was established in the international tribunals after the
Second World War is duly noted by every scholar of the trials, but as
Sikking notes, the individualization of the victim is also important.
This is not at all clear in many of the charges issued in the
international tribunals, which played such a heavy emphasis on the
crimes of aggression that involved Germany and Japan’s invasion of its
neighbors. In these cases, the victims were the occupied countries as a
whole and, compared to later war crimes trials for conflicts in
Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the ties to individual atrocities were somewhat
more tenuous. It was in the national-level war crimes trials and in the
American military tribunals that the individualization of the victim was
most prominent. In these trials Japanese military police were tied
directly to their torture victims and Japanese generals tried, for
example, for command responsibility in the cases of massacres in Manila
or the horrors of the Bataan death march. In historical terms, this
second shift is even more important when we move beyond an effort to
trace transitional justice as a process with clearly defined origins
somewhere in the twentieth century, or else as emerging boldly from a
long and tainted history of political trials. The extent to which this
was also achieved in postwar treason trials for atrocities is more
mixed. In the treason trials we have looked at, in the Philippines, for
example, this individualization did happen to a certain extent. Victims
of specific acts of violence could face the perpetrators of torture and
massacre in trials. Under the rules for complex crimes, however, they
shared their status of victim with the nation. When Constabulary, or
Puppet Armies were returned to service after proving their loyalty or
joining the revolution, their wartime atrocities could be completely
whitewashed since it was understood that their primary crime, if any,
was a nation, or Party, willing to forgive its children.

*The Long Decline of Treason*

\
 Treason is a crime of the most dangerous and fatal consequence to
society, it is of a most malignant nature; it is of a crimson colour,
and of a scarlet dye. \
 - *Pennsylvania v. John Roberts* (1778)[^^[801]^^](#_ftn801)\
 \

What came before transitional justice and its crimes against humanity?
More often than not, in times of violent political transition or
‘successor trials,’ it was treason which reigned.[^^[802]^^](#_ftn802)
Were all the trials of this kind before 1945 merely cynical grabs for
power or efforts to weaken competitors? I don’t think that is fair, but
there is no need to argue that point here. Political trials up until the
mid-twentieth century, especially those in transition, typically did not
individualize the victim. When they bothered to defined one, the crime
was against an injured party, to be sure, but that injured party was
often a community, a realm, a way of living, a political party, or a
nation. The major exception to this was in the age before the
nation-state when, as in old English treason laws for example, the
accusation was of, “compassing the king’s death” or “levying war against
him.”[^^[803]^^](#_ftn803) In the Tang dynasty legal code, treason was
closely tied to parricide and was eventually given identical
sentencing.[^^[804]^^](#_ftn804) The convictions themselves, however,
were often for acts in which the monarch was the sovereign and only
corporeal representation of any real individuals harmed. Also, while
treating the sovereign as the violated party was widespread, it was not
true of all treason laws before the rise of the modern nation-state. In
the Roman Republic and the empire that followed, the treasonous crime of
*maiestas* was short for *maiestas minuta populi Romani* or “diminishing
the majesty of the Roman people,” and the ancient Athenian crimes of
betrayal and subversion were for the betrayal and subversion of Athenian
democracy.[^^[805]^^](#_ftn805)

Treason was rarely alone, but it was almost always lead protagonist of
any conspiracy. To it was often attached any number of heinous deeds, as
in the case of the indictment of Charles I above. For the most part,
however, they were secondary crimes, supporting actors in a plot of
betrayal. At the trial of King Louis XVI in late 1792, several dozen
complex charges were brought against him, but many of them focused on
accusations he had conspired with the enemies of France. It was these
charges, claimed Camille Benoít Desmoulins in his passionate speech
advocating for a sentence of execution, that were most, “odious to the
people,” since, “Treason was always with every nation the most
abominable of crimes.”[^^[806]^^](#_ftn806) As far as I have been able
to determine, Desmoulins was right. The crimes of betrayal, however they
were named, were usually among the most despised of all crimes. Of the
“ten abominations” that constituted the most despicable crimes in the
Ming dynasty code, for example, half are crimes of betrayal and
disobedience on some scale: plotting rebellion, plotting great sedition,
plotting treason, contumacy, and lack of filial
piety.[^^[807]^^](#_ftn807)

If Nuremberg, Tokyo, and the many other war crimes trials of the early
aftermath of the war were a powerful foundational moment in the rise of
transitional justice and the ‘justice cascade’ effect, they were
preceded by a long tail of important developments in law and human
rights. These included the nineteenth century campaigns against slavery,
the Hague conventions, the response to the horrors of the First World
War, and the minority rights movement in the League of Nations. We are
now witnessing a reverse of this trend in the case of treason. The great
collaboration trials after the war–where they reached any significant
scale–represented a last global surge in retribution against those who
had betrayed the nation; those who violated what the moral philosopher
Michael Sandel might call the ‘obligations of solidarity’ that he and
other communitarians hold to be inescapable.[^^[808]^^](#_ftn808)

Of course, treason did not disappear from the face of the earth at the
close of the 1940s, but the postwar period can be described as its long
declining tail. It remains strongest outside of the courtrooms, where a
passionate hatred for those who are seen to have betrayed the loyalties
demanded by community may well be a constant of human society. Almost
every conflict of the postwar involved cries of traitor as well as
summary executions and disappearances carried out in the name of
punishing treason. The two greatest genocides of the postwar period, in
Cambodia and in Rwanda fed upon it. In Cambodia, the victims were
accused traitors to the communist *Angkar,*or the ‘organization.’ Their
confessions, obtained under torture, described acts of petty sabotage
against the revolution that were punished with execution in the killing
fields. In Rwanda, the wholesale massacre of Tutsis and their Hutu
“collaborators” is a famous example of ethnic violence, but it was
partly justified by their alleged treasonous support of rebels and other
conspiracies of betrayal. In the revolutionary wars of Libya and Syria
too, rebels have aggressively hunted down and massacred suspected
informers and government sympathizers, while all the authoritarian
governments affected by the Arab Spring have more than matched them in
their own efforts to liquidate traitors.

In courts around the world, however, a change is easy to recognize, even
in legal systems that fall far short of international calls for
fairness. Together with the shift in the legitimacy of the norm that
represents the ‘justice cascade,’ we are witnessing the gradual decline
of treason as the preferred means of judicial retribution. Increasingly,
the victim is no longer defined as the nation as a whole. With each
small step towards the recognition of individuals as victims, with each
of their personal suffering highlighted, and as each assailant is drawn
into the various practices that constitute transitional justice, treason
dies a little. In the Greek trials of the military junta and its police
forces in 1974, the leaders of the military junta were all tried for
high treason in the first trial, but the subsequent trials were for
torture and murder alone. In the wave of transitions in Latin America,
those that held trials would increasingly charge their former leaders
and their police and military organs with human rights crimes while
those including charges of treason decreased in number. However troubled
they were as legal proceedings, the trial of Saddam Hussein in Iraq was
for crimes against humanity, of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia (in
absentia) was for complicity in the murder of 43 protesters, and against
Hosni Mubarak in Egypt for complicity with murder of protesters and
corruption. None of these trials included charges of treason.

As always, there are exceptions. In South Korea, former presidents were
tried for treason but were quickly amnestied in 1997. A much-noted
Special Act in 2004 was passed to investigate the treasonous conduct of
colonial period collaborators and an act was passed in 2005 to
confiscate the property of some colonial collaborators. Even in a Korea,
where a long suppression of the collaboration issue has contributed to
widespread interest in recent years, these acts were far outnumbered by
other acts of legislation that have helped the country confront the
atrocities of Korea’s recent history, including the removal of statutes
of limitation on human rights crimes, acts to investigate suspicious
deaths and establish a process of truth and
reconciliation.[^^[809]^^](#_ftn809) Some of these changes are no doubt
due partly in thanks to pressure from international organizations and
other states that provide aid to countries in transition. Left to carry
out retribution without outside interference, some states would
doubtlessly continue to carry out trials for treason in unwitting
imitation of their predecessors. In February, 2012, one of the first
trials in Libya after its recent revolution charged 50 people of the
crime of “treason against the revolution,” but this was the same crime
that was used by Qaddafi's government to punish the opponents that now
came to power. The trial was delayed, however, and more recent
proceedings list charges that highlight the atrocities of the
accused.[^^[810]^^](#_ftn810)

What we are witnessing is not the outcome of a zero sum game but
something close to it. Amartya Sen argues, and I agree, that a theory of
justice must acknowledge the strength of “plural grounding,” the idea
that we may disagree on what may be the “dominant reason for the
diagnosis of injustice” in any given case, but that we should be able to
identify a “plurality of impartial reasons” in our
condemnations.[^^[811]^^](#_ftn811) Charges of betrayal of a nation or
community, so closely linked to the core positionality of the accuser
and the accused, are generally poor candidates in establishing such
impartial reasons for condemnation–especially when there are
alternatives to be had in the form of tangible harms committed against
specific people. Nor do they sit well with Sen’s call for
non-parochialism as a required component of justice. I hold that it is
extremely difficult to, “view our sentiments from a certain distance
from us” on the one hand, and navigate the complex layers of shifting
loyalty that emerge in wars and revolution on the
other.[^^[812]^^](#_ftn812) When treason is replaced by crimes against
humanity, it is not just a process of individualization at play, but one
of universalization. While that is certainly a move in the direction of
non-parochialism, it is true that this transformation has also given
rise to a host of debates and critiques of its own. The way forward may
not be clear, but at least one thing is. If the continued rise of
transitional justice and international humanitarian law threatens the
sovereignty of the nation-state, then the decline of treason threatens
its soul.

**Appendix A: The Philippine Amnesty Proclamation of 1948**

**Proclamation No. 51 - A Proclamation Granting Amnesty**

**January 28, 1948**

WHEREAS, the occupation of the Philippines by the Japanese armed forces
during the last war and the organization by them of a government
administered by citizens of the Philippines but subject to their
direction and control have given rise to charges of collaboration with
the enemy against such citizens of the Philippines who occupied
positions in that government, as well as against those who traded with
the enemy;

WHEREAS, as a result of those charges, indictments have been filed
against a large number of Filipino citizens for alleged treasonable
collaboration with the enemy before the People’s Court, which was
established especially to hear and try those cases;

WHEREAS, these trails have been held for more than two years now, but no
final judgments convicting any one of the accused have been rendered;

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court has declared that the mere holding of a
position in the government established by the enemy does not per se
constitute the crime of treason under the laws of the Philippines;

WHEREAS, with respect to those who are at present indicted for alleged
trading with the enemy, it appears that because aside from the
requirements of the two-witness rule in treason trials, it has been
declared necessary to prove specifically that the materials involved in
the trading were essential to the prosecution of the war, no final
judgments of conviction have been entered so far in such cases and, on
the contrary, several verdicts of acquittal have been rendered and
orders of dismissal issued;

WHEREAS, the majority of the Filipino people now realize that the
alleged acts attributed to political collaborators either were not
voluntary on their part or, in effect, were performed by them in the
sincere belief that it was their patriotic duty to execute them in the
interest of the safety and well-being of their countrymen who were then
at the mercy of the enemy;

WHEREAS, with the lapse of time there has come a better understanding on
the part of the Filipino people of the motives which actuated the
persons who held positions under the occupation government, and there is
evidence that a majority of the people have fully vindicated the
accused, convinced that in the discharge of their functions as public
officials they did everything in their power to minimize the atrocities
of the enemy and to prevent the carrying out of his purpose to induce or
compel the Filipino people to arm themselves against the allied nations;

WHEREAS, under the laws of the Philippines and the doctrines laid down
by our courts the prosecution of the cases now pending appears
unjustified with regard to alleged political collaborators and futile as
to those charged with economic collaboration;

WHEREAS, the question of collaboration has divided the people of the
Philippines since liberation in a manner which threatens the unity of
the nation at a time when the public welfare requires that said unity be
safeguarded and preserved;

WHEREAS, the question of collaboration is essentially political in
nature and should be settled in accordance with the conscience of the
majority of the people;

WHEREAS, it appears that the overwhelming sentiment of the people of
this Republic is now in favor of resolving this question as speedily as
possible by the grant of amnesty to all persons who have been accused or
may hereafter be accused of treason through alleged collaboration with
the enemy;

WHEREAS, this public sentiment does not extend to persons who
voluntarily took up arms against the alleged nations or the members of
the resistance forces, or acted as spies or informers of the enemy, or
committed murder, arson, coercion, robbery, physical injuries or any
other crime defined and punished in our penal laws, for the purpose of
aiding and abetting the enemy in the war against the allied nations, or
in the suppression of the resistance movement in the Philippines;

NOW, THEREFORE, I, Manuel Roxas, President of the Philippines by virtue
of the power in me vested by Article VII, section 10 (6) of the
Constitution, so hereby proclaim and grant full and complete amnesty to
all persons accused of any offense against the national security for
acts allegedly committed to give aid and comfort to the enemy during the
last war; provided, however, That this amnesty shall not extend to
persons who are now or may hereafter be accused of treason for having
taken up arms against the allied nations or the members of the
resistance forces, for having voluntarily acted as spies or informers of
the enemy, or for having committed murder, arson, coercion, robbery,
physical injuries, or any other crime against person or property, for
the purpose of aiding and abetting the enemy in the war against the
allied nations or in the suppression of the resistance movement in the
Philippines.

All cases now pending before the courts for alleged offenses coming
within the terms of the amnesty herein granted shall be dismissed by the
respective courts on their own motion or upon petition by the
prosecution or the accused.

This proclamation shall take effect upon the concurrence therewith by
the Congress.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of
the Republic of the Philippines to be affixed.

Done in the City of Manila, this 28th day of January, in the year of Our
Lord, nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the
Philippines, the second.

is a Collaborator.” This essay is famous, as Treat points out, for its
depiction of collaboration as a “strange mixture of masochism and
homosexuality,” which supports a “sexual union in which France plays the
female role…” However, the full essay shows the same confused depictions
of collaboration as a universal phenomenon and one tied to betrayal in
the context of a foreign occupation and illicit ties to the Other. It
is, for Sartre, a “normal phenomenon” which lies “latent” in peace, but
is elsewhere described more generally as anyone who is afflicted by,
“that intellectual illness that may be called historicism.” This
historicism yields a twisted realism which, “leads them to submit
themselves to rigorously individual realities: a man, a party or a
foreign nation.” See Jean-Paul Sartre “What is a Collaborator?” in

Conroy, in his short essay on collaboration, in which he also argued
that the term was plagued by its close orientation with the
nation-state. Hilary Conroy “Thoughts on Collaboration” Peace and Change
1.1 (1972), 43.  Brook goes beyond a critique of the term to argue for a
more cautious approach to moral judgments about the past in general,
offering instead a historian’s imperative to produce “moral
understanding” that is based upon an appreciation for the contingent
outcomes of the actions of historical agents. I share with Treat a
strong commitment to the moral agency of the historian and am far less
troubled than Brook by the consequences of retroactive judgement in our
craft. Brook wants to distinguish the work of the moralizing
‘polemicist’ from that of the historian but his own important study of
local collaboration in occupation China goes farther than most in
carefully spelling out the consequences of collaboration in the midst of
mass atrocities. Nor does Brook shy away from drawing some of the
obvious conclusions, as he does when he evaluates the work of the
Self-Government Committee (自治委員會) in the newly Japanese occupied
city of Nanjing. When the body asserted control over refugees in
January, 1938 it aided a process in which males of fighting age were
extracted and handed over for execution which, as Brook points out,
amounted to, “complicity in war crimes.” Timothy Brook. *Collaboration:

Korean term “pro-Japanese” (親日派) when talking about collaboration in
Korea, the Chinese term for traitor (漢奸) or other more neutral terms
for the specific factions that worked for Japan. The more generic term
for collaborators with Japan (対日協力者) is only gradually being
adopted in more recent works. In Korean scholarship, various terms for
traitor (민족반역자, 民族叛逆者) or pro-Japanese (친일파, 親日派)
continue to be most prominent, while later collaborators are sometimes
described within a general framework of fascism (파시즘).

punish perpetrators of the Armenian massacres following the signing of
the Treaty of Sevres in 1920 also floundered. In both cases there were
weak national level trials: in the German case at Leipzig, and the
earlier Constantinople court-martials for Armenian massacres under the
Ottomans.

[^^[23]^^](#_ftnref23) The concept behind crimes against humanity was
seen as derived from the prologue to the 1907 Hague Convention, which
referred to the laws of humanity. The specific category of “crimes
against humanity” was proposed in 1919 in the “Report on the Commission
on the Responsibilities of the Authors of War and on Enforcement of
Penalties,“ following the First World War, but due to American and
Japanese opposition, the proposal to prosecute such crimes was dropped.

the “subsequent proceedings,” the indictments did sometimes include
crimes against peace such as in the *Ministries* and *High Command*
trials. See Kevin Jon Heller, *The Nuremberg Military Tribunals and the
Origins of International Criminal Law* (OUP Oxford, 2011), 127. The
reverse was not true, since many of the leaders prosecuted at the IMTFE,
that are widely referred to as “Class A” war criminals were, in addition
to crimes against peace, also indicted and convicted on charges of
murder, crimes against humanity, and conventional war crimes. On the
inclusion of regular murder charges, and the reaction of the judges to
these counts, see Neil Boister, *The Tokyo International Military

has been done by Utsumi Aiko 内海愛子 and Hayashi Hirofumi林博史, who
have both written extensively on the national level trials and the
remarkable series of documents edited by Chaen Yoshio茶園義男 remains
the most important published collection of primary materials on these

Hirofumi Hayashi 林博史, BC急戦犯裁判 [BC-Class War Crimes Trials]
(Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 2005). The U.S. military tribunals that
convicted generals Yamashita and Homma in the Philippines were an early
topic of research due to their important contribution to doctrine of
command responsibility. Philip Piccigalo’s work on allied war crimes
trials in Asia covered many of the national level trials but depended
heavily on contemporary press accounts and the fifteen volumes of the
*Law Reports of the Trials of War Criminals* selected by the United
Nations War Crimes Commission. Philip R. Piccigallo, *The Japanese on

Korean War memorandum “Policy on Strafing Civilians” during
investigations into the massacre at No Gun Ri which noted that the Air
Force had complied with Army requests to date for the strafing of
civilians shows that this policy continued, at least in some cases, into
the postwar.  The U.S. military’s own review report admits to the
existence of the memorandum but overal denies that there was any
explicit order to strafe civilians. See Department of the Army Inspector

was complicated by at least two factors. One was a debate over in what

which completed its occupation of the country in less than a day. The
second was whether acts of collaboration before 1943, when the minimal
German interference in Danish affairs began to change radically, were to

complex one and will not be reviewed in detail. Already before the fall
of Singapore some 200 “Fujiwara volunteers” had formed, named for the
then Major Fujiwara Iwaichi, whose intelligence outfit the *Fujiwara
Kikan* was responsible for creating an army of Indian volunteers.
However, the term “Fujiwara volunteers” are elsewhere described as those
who joined just after Singapore fell. The “first” Indian National Army
that grew out of it commanded by Mohan Singh and tied to the Indian
Independence League led by Rash Behari Bose in Tokyo. This first INA was
disbanded by Singh in December, 1942, after which he was arrested by the
Japanese. The INA only revived with the arrival of Subhas Chandra Bose
in the summer of 1943. For this earlier period see Hugh Toye “The First
Indian National Army, 1941-42.” *Journal of Southeast Asian Studies* 15,

description of the policy options by suggesting that, up until this
point, only a few cases had become “ripe for prosecution” and thus had
resulted in convictions. However, this ignored the fact that those few
convictions that had been reached during the war led directly, as noted

proceed with Courts of Inquiry. In other words, any requisite ripening
was being actively prevented by the army.

[^^[212]^^](#_ftnref212) The execution is remembered as part of what has
become known as the Selarang Barracks Incident at Changi prison in
September, 1942 when the camp’s POWs almost all refused to obey a
Japanese order to sign a document pledging not to attempt escape from
the camp. Following the execution, the prisoners were all crammed into a
small area around the central square of the camp in dangerously cramp
conditions which eventually lead to compliance. The attempt to compel
the prisoners to sign, and the moving of the prisoners into the square
comprised the other charge in Fukuei’s postwar trial. Havers offers a
full chapter account of the incidnet in *ibid.,*65-80. A synopsis of
Fukue’s war crimes trial, no. 235/825, and the identification of Captain
Rawa as the head of the firing squad is found online at the University

Guangzhou, the three soon received the help of none other than INA

regards to the specific nature of the treason in question is that, while
the INA was composed in large part of deserters, which thus stood in
strong contrast to loyal Indians who continue to fight for the British
throughout the war, there were few Burmese veterans of British forces
within the BNA, not surprising given the fact the British rarely
recruited among ethnic Burmans. See Annexure III in “Cabinet: India and

crimes as war crimes and addressing them as such in either international

rape’s use as a weapon of war is your concern, for example, you can
safely contest the meanings of “war crime” or “crimes against humanity,”
and hope that through redefining rape as a war crime, rather than a
‘natural,’ ‘inevitable,’ ‘boys-will-be-boys’ inherent aspect of war,
there will be some deterrent effect. But if it is off-limits to address
the intersections of gender and ethnicity, and the gender regime that
makes a physical, sexual attack on a woman a blow against the ‘honour’
of a man and his community, how likely is it that rape will stop being
used as a weapon?” Carol Cohn “Mainstreaming Gender in UN Security

diplomat the pardon was entirely driven by a Christian spirit. Nagai
Hitoshi suggests another related influence on a religious Quirino may
have been the interest the Vatican took in the issue of showing mercy to
the Japanese war criminals. Nagai *Firipin to Tainichi Senpan Saiban*,
282. The announcement on the evening of June 27th by the presidential
office however, connected the “gesture” of the pardons to the
improvement of relations and the reparations issue directly. A more
direct *quid pro quo* has also been suggested. While no direct evidence
has emerged, Nagai writes there is some  possibility that accusations
published elsewhere that a direct payment made to the Quirino regime
behind the scenes for the pardons may have merit, and statements made
immediately after the announcement of the pardons continued to suggest
Quirino was hoping the pardons would have an impact on reparations
negotiations. See discussion by Nagai, *Firipin to Tainichi Senpan
Saiban*,  282-292, and Chamberlain, “Justice and Reconciliation”,
180-190. Ricardo T. Jose suggests that growing U.S. pressure on the

own story shows once again the complex world of betrayal all this took
place in. He was a confidant of Dai Li, the head of *juntong*until his
death in 1945 and was head of the *juntong* station in Nanjing at the
time of the trial. However, by the time he testified at Zhou Fohai’s
trial where he also testified to Zhou Fohai’s cooperation with *juntong*
and embarrassed the Nationalist party, Zhou had allegedly already
secretly joined the Communist party and would soon be under arrest
himself. Whether his claims about Zhou Fohai, Wu Huawen and other puppet
commander relations with *juntong* were true is thus complicated by his
potential other loyalties at the time.  See Guo Biqiang 郭必強

other areas where Communist led guerrillas were active. Despite
following similar policies and finding recognizable patterns in the
broad sweep of political and military campaigns, it is important to
recognize the considerable local variation in various areas held by
Communist forces. Even limiting the discussion to Shandong, this chapter
does not do full justice to the occasional divergences between Communist
forces operating near the Yimeng mountains and the rest of central
Shandong, and those in the hills of the Jiaodong peninsula.

least, he did not take the use of puppet troops very seriously. When
pressed on the issue of underutilizing puppet troops in China before the

intelligent about them, except to recall vaguely that some had served
the Japanese under a “general named Wang.”  See the discussion on the

Chinese. In contrast with Nationalist legal cases, in Communist

others mentioned in the document were puppet soldiers and various other
Chinese collaborators, with no reference made to Japanese soldiers. A
chart it included divided those who were put before mass rallies into
Nationalist spy suspected of treason (國（兼漢奸）特), puppet official
(偽官長), enemy spy (敵特), puppet soldier(偽（兵）軍), and generic
traitor (漢奸). 16 out of 155 were executed.  Rizhao county Public

for example, were protected by amnesties passed in the 1960s. Further,
“crimes against humanity” were, until very recently, only recognized in
postwar France when the accused were connected to the Axis powers, as
established in the London Charter. Yves Beigbeder, *Judging War Crimes

Ireland v. United Kingdom* for its ‘five techniques’ of torture of Irish
Republican Army suspects. However, not only was this an international
suit, one of few before the European court, but also these did not
include the beating, flogging, and electricity used in some of its
colonial territories. For more on the case see John Conroy, *Unspeakable

political and social theorist Jon Elster, who has argued persuasively
that study of transitional justice as such must not limit itself to
modern or democratic regimes. Only by studying the larger universe of
cases–and his work looks as far back as ancient Athens–can we fully
appreciate the ways in which, for example, communities learn from past
transitions. Jon Elster *Closing the Books*, 1-2.

administration which has decried the way these investigations, including
the act against collaborators, has become a political weapon of its
opponents, but in this it strongly resembles the way in which the
shifting politics of post-1989 politics in East Europe has had a heavy
